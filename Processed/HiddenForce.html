<p class="first"><i>The Hidden Force</i> gives a picture of life in the
Dutch East Indies in the last year of the nineteenth and the first year
of the twentieth century. Conditions have altered slightly since
then&mdash;Dutch ladies no longer wear &ldquo;sarong&rdquo; and
&ldquo;kabaai&rdquo; so generally, and there are other minor
changes&mdash;but the relations between the Europeans and the natives
remain very much as they were.</p>
<p>I have translated nearly all the Malay and Javanese words scattered
through the text, agreeing with my publisher that the sense of colour
throughout the book is strong enough without insisting on these native
terms, and I have done my best to reduce foot-notes to a minimum.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">The full moon wore the hue of tragedy that
evening. It had risen early, during the last glimmer of daylight, in
the semblance of a huge, blood-red ball, and, flaming like a sunset low
down behind the tamarind-trees in the Lange Laan, it was ascending,
slowly divesting itself of its tragic complexion, in a pallid sky. A
deathly stillness lay over all things like a veil, as though, after the
long mid-day siesta, the evening rest were beginning without an
intervening period of life. Over the town, whose white villas and
porticoes lay huddled amid the trees of the lanes and gardens, hung the
windless oppression of the evening air, as though the listless night
were weary of the blazing day of eastern monsoon. The houses, from
which not a sound was heard, shrank away, in deathly silence, amid the
foliage of their gardens, with their evenly-spaced, gleaming rows of
great whitewashed flower-pots. Here and there a lamp was already lit.
Suddenly a dog barked and another answered, rending the muffled silence
into long, ragged tatters: the dogs&rsquo; angry throats sounded
hoarse, panting, harshly hostile; then they, too, suddenly fell
silent.</p>
<p>At the end of the Lange Laan the Residency lay far back in its
grounds. Low and vivid in the darkness of the banyan-trees, it lifted
the zig-zag outline of its tiled roofs, one behind the other, against
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>the dark background of the garden, with one crude
line of letters and numerals that dated the whole: a roof over each
gallery and verandah, a roof over each room, receding into one long
outline of irregular roofs. In front, however, rose the white pillars
of the front verandah, and the white pillars of the portico, gleaming
tall and stately, set far apart, with a large, welcoming spaciousness,
making the roomy entrance impressive as a palace doorway. Through the
open doors the central gallery was seen in dim perspective, running
through to the back, lit by a single flickering light.</p>
<p>A native messenger was lighting the lanterns beside the house.
Semicircles of great white pots with roses and chrysanthemums, with
palms and caladiums, curved widely to right and left in front of the
house. A broad gravel path formed the drive to the white-pillared
portico; next came a wide, parched lawn, surrounded by flower-pots,
and, in the middle, on a carved stone pedestal, a monumental vase,
holding a tall latania. The only fresh green was that of the meandering
pond, on which floated the giant leaves of a Victoria Regia, huddled
together like round green tea-trays, with here and there a bright
lotus-like flower between them. A path wound beside the pond; and on a
circular space paved with pebbles stood a tall flag-staff, with the
flag already hauled down, as it was every day at six o&rsquo;clock. A
plain gate divided the grounds from the Lange Laan.</p>
<p>The vast grounds were silent. There were now burning, slowly and
laboriously lit by the lamp-boy, one lamp in the chandelier in the
front verandah and one indoors, turned low, like two <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>night-lights in a palace which, with its pillars
and its vanishing perspective of roofs, was somehow reminiscent of a
child&rsquo;s dream. On the steps of the office a few messengers, in
their dark uniforms, sat talking in whispers. One of them stood up
after a while and walked, with a quiet, leisurely step, to a bronze
bell which hung high, by the messengers&rsquo; lodge, in the extreme
corner of the grounds. When he had reached it, after taking about a
hundred paces, he sounded seven slow, reverberating strokes. The
clapper struck the bell with a brazen, booming note; and each stroke
was prolonged by an undulating echo, a deep, thrilling vibration. The
dogs began to bark again. The messenger, boyishly slender in his blue
cloth jacket with yellow facings and trousers with yellow stripes,
slowly and quietly, with supple step, retraced his hundred paces to the
other messengers.</p>
<p>A light now shone in the office and also in the adjoining bedroom,
from which it filtered through the Venetian blinds. The resident, a
tall, heavy man, in a black jacket and white duck trousers, walked
across the room and called to the man outside:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messenger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief messenger, in a cloth uniform jacket edged with broad
yellow braid, approached with bended knees and squatted before his
master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call Miss Doddie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Doddie is out, excellency,&rdquo; whispered the man,
while with his two hands, the fingers placed together, he sketched the
reverential gesture of the salaam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where has she gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not ask, excellency,&rdquo; said the man, by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>way of excuse for not knowing, again with his
sketchy salaam.</p>
<p>The resident reflected for a moment. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cap. My stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief messenger, still bending his knees as though reverently
shrinking into himself, scuttled across the room, and, squatting,
presented an undress uniform cap and a walking-stick.</p>
<p>The resident went out. The chief messenger hurried after him,
carrying in his hand a long, burning slow-match, of which he waved the
glowing tip from side to side so that the resident might be seen by any
one passing in the dark. The resident walked slowly through the garden
to the Lange Laan. Along this lane, an avenue of tamarind-trees and
flamboyants, lay the villas of the more important townsfolk, faintly
lighted, deathly silent, apparently uninhabited, with their rows of
whitewashed flower-pots gleaming in the vague dusk of the evening.</p>
<p>The resident first passed the secretary&rsquo;s house; then, on the
other side, a girls&rsquo; school; then the notary&rsquo;s house, an
hotel, the post-office, and the house of the president of the Criminal
Court. At the end of the Lange Laan stood the Catholic church; and,
farther on, across the river-bridge, lay the railway-station. Near the
station was a large European store, which was more brilliantly lighted
than the other buildings. The moon had climbed higher, turning a
brighter silver in its ascent, and now shone down upon the white
bridge, the white store and the white church, all standing round a
square, treeless, open space, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href=
"#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>in the middle of which was the
town-clock, a small monument with a pointed spire.</p>
<p>The resident met nobody; now and then, however, an occasional
Javanese, like a moving shadow, appeared out of the darkness; and then
the messenger waved the glowing point of his wick with great
ostentation behind his master. As a rule, the Javanese understood and
made himself small, cowering along the edge of the road and passing
with a scuttling gait. Now and again an ignorant native, just arrived
from his village, did not understand, but went by, looking in terror at
the messenger, who merely waved his wick, and, in passing, sent a curse
after the fellow, behind his master&rsquo;s back, because he, the
village yokel, had no manners. When a cart or trap approached he waved
his little fiery star again and again through the darkness and made
signs to the driver, who either stopped and alighted or squatted in his
little carriage, and, so squatting, drove on along the farther side of
the road.</p>
<p>The resident went on gloomily, with the smart step of a resolute
walker. He had turned off to the right of the little square and was now
walking past the Protestant church, making straight for a handsome
villa adorned with slender, fairly correct Ionian plaster pillars and
brilliantly lighted with paraffin lamps set in chandeliers. This was
the Concordia Club. A couple of native servants in white jackets sat on
the steps. A European in a white suit, the steward, passed along the
verandah. But there was no one sitting at the great
gin-and-bitters-table; and the wide cane chairs opened their arms
expectantly but in vain. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>The steward, on seeing the resident, bowed; and the resident,
raising his finger to his cap, went past the club and turned to the
left. He walked down a lane, past dark little houses, each in its own
little demesne, turned off again and walked along the mouth of the
river, which was like a canal. Proa after proa lay moored to the banks;
the monotonous humming of Maduran seamen crept drearily across the
water, from which rose a smell of fish. Past the harbour-master&rsquo;s
office the resident made for the pier, which projected some way into
the sea and at the end of which a small lighthouse, a miniature Eiffel
tower, stood like an iron candlestick, with its lamp at the top. Here
the resident stopped and filled his lungs with the night air. The
breeze had suddenly freshened, the north-east wind had risen, blowing
in from the offing, as it did daily at this hour. But sometimes it
suddenly dropped again, unexpectedly, as though its fanning wings had
been stricken powerless; and the roughened sea fell again, until its
curdling, foaming breakers, white in the moonlight, were replaced by
smooth rollers, slightly phosphorescent in long, pale streaks.</p>
<p>A mournful and monotonous rhythm of dreary singing approached over
the sea; a sail loomed darkly, like a great night-bird; and a fishing
proa with a high, curved stem, suggesting an ancient galley, glided
into the channel. A melancholy resignation to life, an acquiescence in
all the small, obscure things of earth beneath that infinite sky, upon
that remote, phosphorescent sea, was adrift in the night, conjuring up
an oppressive mystery&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span></p>
<p>The tall, sturdy man who stood there, with straddling legs,
breathing in the loitering, fitful wind, tired with his work, with
sitting at his writing-table, with calculating the
<i>duiten</i>-question, that important matter, the abolition of the
<i>duit</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e440src" href="#xd26e440" name=
"xd26e440src">1</a> for which the governor-general had made him
personally responsible: this tall, sturdy man, practical, cool-headed,
quick in decision from the long habit of authority, was perhaps
unconscious of the mysterious shadow that drifted over the native town,
over the capital of his district, in the night; but he was conscious of
a yearning for affection. He vaguely felt a longing for a child&rsquo;s
arms around his neck, for shrill little voices about him, a longing for
a young wife awaiting him with a smile. He did not give definite
expression to this sentimentality in his thoughts; it was not his habit
to give way to musing upon his individual needs; he was too busy, his
days were too full of interests of all kinds for him to yield to what
he knew to be his moments of weakness, the suppressed ebullitions of
his younger years. But, though he did not reflect, the mood upon him
was not to be thrown off; it was like a pressure on his sturdy chest,
like a morbid tenderness, like a sentimental discomfort in the
otherwise highly practical mind of this superior official, who was
strongly attached to his sphere of work, to his territory, who had its
interests at heart, in whom the almost independent power of his post
harmonized entirely with his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href=
"#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>authoritative nature, and who was
accustomed with his strong lungs to breathe an atmosphere of spacious
activity and extensive, varied work, even as he now stood breathing the
spacious wind from the sea.</p>
<p>A longing, a desire, a certain nostalgia filled him more than was
usual that evening. He felt lonely, not merely because of the isolation
which nearly always surrounds the head of a native government, who is
approached either with formality and smiling respect, for purposes of
conversation, or curtly, with official respect, for purposes of
business. He felt lonely, though he was the father of a family. He
thought of his big house, he thought of his wife and children. And he
felt lonely and borne up merely by the interest which he took in his
work. That was the one thing in his life. It filled all his waking
hours. He fell asleep thinking of it; and his first thought in the
morning was of some district interest.</p>
<p>Tired with casting up figures, at this moment, breathing the wind,
he inhaled together with the coolness of the sea its melancholy, the
mysterious melancholy of the Indian seas, the haunting melancholy of
the seas of Java, the melancholy that rushes in from afar on
whispering, mysterious wings. But it was not his nature to yield to
mystery. He denied mystery. It was not there: there was only the sea
and the cool wind. There was only the sea-fog, with its mingled savour
of fish and flowers and seaweed, a savour which the cool wind was
blowing away. There was only the moment of respiration; and such
mysterious melancholy as he, nevertheless, irresistibly felt stealing
that evening through his somewhat softened mood he believed to be
connected <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>with his domestic circle: he would have liked to
feel that this circle was a little more compact, fitting more closely
around the father and husband in him. If there was any cause for
melancholy, it was that. It did not come from the sea, nor from the
distant sky. He refused to yield to any sudden sensation of the
uncanny. And he set his feet more firmly, flung out his chest, lifted
his fine, soldierly head and snuffed up the smell of the sea and the
fragrance of the wind&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The chief messenger, squatting with his glowing wick in his hand,
peeped attentively at his master, as though thinking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange, those Hollanders!&hellip; What is he thinking
now?&hellip; Why is he behaving like this?&hellip; Just at this time
and on this spot?&hellip; The sea-spirits are about now&#8202;&hellip;.
There are caymans under the water, and every cayman is a
spirit&#8202;&hellip;. Look, they have been sacrificing to them there:
bananas and rice and meat dried in the sun and a hard-boiled egg, on a
little bamboo raft, down by the foot of the light-house&#8202;&hellip;.
What is the sahib doing here?&hellip; It is not good here, it is not
good here, alas, alas!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And his watching eyes glided up and down the back of his master, who
simply stood and gazed into the distance: what was he gazing
at?&hellip; What did he see blowing up in the wind?&hellip; How
strange, those Hollanders, how strange!&hellip;</p>
<p>The resident turned, suddenly, and walked back; and the messenger,
starting up, followed him, blowing the tip of his slow-match. The
resident walked back by the same road; there was now a member sitting
in the club, who greeted him; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18"
href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>a couple of young men were
strolling in the Lange Laan. The dogs were barking.</p>
<p>When the resident approached the entrance to the residency, he saw
before him, standing by the other gate, two white figures, a man and a
girl, who vanished into the darkness under the banyans. He went
straight to his office; another messenger came up and took his cap and
stick. Then he sat down at his writing-table. He had time for an
hour&rsquo;s work before dinner. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19"

<p class="first dropcap">A few of the lamps had been lit. Really the
lamps were burning everywhere; but in the long, broad galleries it was
only just light. In the grounds and inside the house there were
certainly no fewer than twenty or thirty paraffin-lamps burning in
chandeliers and lanterns; but they yielded no more than a vague, yellow
twilight glimmering through the house. A flood of moonshine poured into
the garden, making the flower-pots gleam brightly and shimmering in the
pond; and the banyans were like soft velvet against the luminous
sky.</p>
<p>The first gong had sounded for dinner. In the front verandah a young
man was swinging up and down in a rocking-chair, with his hands behind
his head. He was bored. A young girl came along the middle gallery,
humming to herself, as though in expectation. The house was furnished
in accordance with the conventional type of up-country residencies,
with commonplace splendour. The marble floor of the verandah was white
and glossy as a mirror; tall palms stood in pots between the pillars;
groups of rocking-chairs stood round the marble tables. In the first
inner gallery, which ran parallel with the verandah, chairs were drawn
up against the wall as though in readiness for an eternal reception.
The second inner gallery, which ran from front to back, showed at the
end, where it opened into a cross-gallery, a huge red satin curtain
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>hanging from a gilt cornice. In the white spaces
between the doors of the rooms hung either mirrors in gilt frames,
resting on marble console-tables, or lithographs&mdash;pictures as they
call them in India&mdash;of Van Dyck on horseback; Paolo Veronese
received by a doge on the steps of a Venetian palace, <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e480" title="Source: Shakspeare">Shakespeare</span> at
the court of Elizabeth and Tasso at the court of Este; but in the
biggest panel, in a crowned frame, hung a large etching, a portrait of
Queen Wilhelmina in her coronation-robes. In the middle of the central
gallery was a red satin ottoman, topped by a palm. There were also many
chairs and tables, and everywhere great chandeliers. Everything was
very neatly kept and distinguished by a commonplace pomp, an
uncomfortable readiness for the next reception, with not a single
home-like corner. In the half-light of the paraffin-lamps&mdash;one
lamp was lit in each chandelier&mdash;the long, wide, spacious
galleries stretched in tedious vacancy.</p>
<p>The second gong sounded. In the back-verandah, the long
table&mdash;too long, as though always expecting guests&mdash;was laid
for three persons. The native butler and half-a-dozen boys stood
waiting by the servers&rsquo; tables and the two sideboards. The butler
at once began to fill the soup-plates; and two of the boys placed the
three plates of soup on the table, on top of the folded napkins which
lay on the dinner-plates. Then they waited again, while the soup
steamed gently. Another boy filled the three tumblers with large lumps
of ice.</p>
<p>The girl came in, humming a tune. She was perhaps seventeen, and
resembled her divorced mother, the resident&rsquo;s first wife, a
good-looking half-caste, who was now living in Batavia, where she was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>said to keep a discreet gaming house. The young
girl had a pale olive complexion, sometimes just touched with a
peach-like blush; she had beautiful black hair, curling naturally at
the temples and wound round her head in a heavy coil; her black pupils
and sparkling irises swam in humid bluish-whites, over which her thick
lashes flickered up and down, and up again. Her mouth was small and a
little full; and her upper lip was just shadowed by a dark, downy line.
She was not tall and was already too fully formed, like a hasty rose
that has bloomed too soon. She wore a white piqu&eacute; skirt and a
white linen blouse with lace insertions; and round her throat was a
bright yellow ribbon that accorded well with her olive pallor, which
sometimes flushed up, suddenly, as with a rush of warm blood.</p>
<p>The young man came sauntering in from the front verandah. He was
like his father, tall, broad and fair-haired, with a thick, fair
moustache. He was barely twenty-three, but looked quite five years
older. He wore a suit of white Russian linen, but with a shirt-collar
and tie.</p>
<p>Van Oudijck also came at last: his firm step approached as though he
were always busy, as though he were now coming just to have some dinner
in the midst of his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When does mamma arrive to-morrow?&rdquo; asked Theo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At half-past eleven,&rdquo; replied Van Oudijck; and, turning
to his body-servant behind him, &ldquo;Kario, remember that the
mem-sahib is to be fetched from the station at half-past eleven
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, excellency,&rdquo; murmured Kario. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>The fish was served.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doddie,&rdquo; asked Van Oudijck, &ldquo;who was with you at
the gate just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At &hellip; the gate?&rdquo; she asked slowly, in a very soft
accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At &hellip; the gate?&hellip; Nobody&#8202;&hellip;. Theo
perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you at the gate with your sister?&rdquo; asked Van
Oudijck.</p>
<p>The boy knitted his thick, fair eyebrows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly&#8202;&hellip;. Don&rsquo;t know&#8202;&hellip;.
Don&rsquo;t remember&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were all three silent. They hurried through dinner: sitting at
table bored them. The five or six servants, in white cotton jackets
with red linen facings, moved softly on their flat toes, waiting
quickly and noiselessly. Steak and salad was served, and a pudding,
followed by dessert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everlasting rumpsteak!&rdquo; Theo muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that cook!&rdquo; laughed Doddie, with her little
throaty laugh, clipping her sentences in the half-caste fashion.
&ldquo;She always gives steak, when mamma not here; doesn&rsquo;t
matter to her, when mamma not here. She has no imagination. Too bad
though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had been twenty minutes over their dinner when Van Oudijck went
back to his office. Doddie and Theo sauntered towards the front of the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tedious,&rdquo; Doddie yawned. &ldquo;Come, we play
billiards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the first inner gallery, behind the satin porti&egrave;re, was a
small billiard-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said Theo. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>They played.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why am I supposed to have been with you at the
gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh &hellip; tut!&rdquo; said Doddie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa needn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was with you? Addie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; said Doddie. &ldquo;Say, band playing
to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, we go, yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t care to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With mamma &hellip; you would, yes?&rdquo; said Doddie,
angrily. &ldquo;I know very well. With mamma you go always to the
band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know &hellip; you little minx!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I know?&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;What do I know? I
know what I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he said, to tease her, fluking a cannon.
&ldquo;You and Addie, huh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well &hellip; and you and mamma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to hide from me. Besides, every one says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad of you though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go to the devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung his cue down in a temper and went towards the front of the
house. She followed him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href=
"#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Theo &hellip; don&rsquo;t be angry now. Come along to
the band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never say it again,&rdquo; she entreated,
coaxingly.</p>
<p>She was afraid that he would continue to be angry and then she would
have nothing and nobody, then she would die of boredom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised Addie and I can&rsquo;t go by
myself&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you won&rsquo;t make any more of those idiotic
remarks&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I promise. Theo dear, yes, come
then&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was already in the garden.</p>
<p>Van Oudijck appeared on the threshold of his office, which always
had the door open, but which was separated from the inner gallery by a
large screen:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doddie!&rdquo; he called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you see that there are flowers in mamma&rsquo;s room
to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was almost embarrassed and his eyelids blinked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, papa &hellip; I&rsquo;ll see to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Theo &hellip; to the band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Oudijck became red and angry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the band? But you might have asked my leave first!&rdquo;
he exclaimed, in a sudden temper.</p>
<p>Doddie pouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like you to go out, without my knowing where
you go. You were out this afternoon too, when I wanted you to come for
a walk with me.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25"
name="pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, doesn&rsquo;t matter then!&rdquo; said Doddie, bursting
into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go if you want to,&rdquo; said Van Oudijck,
&ldquo;but I insist on your asking me first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t care about it now,&rdquo; said Doddie, in
tears. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter! No band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They could hear the first strains in the distance, coming from the
Concordia garden.</p>
<p>Van Oudijck returned to his office. Doddie and Theo flung themselves
into two rocking-chairs in the verandah and swung furiously to and fro,
skating with the chairs over the smooth marble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Theo, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go. Addie expects
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she pouted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;ll
tell Addie to-morrow papa so unkind. He spoils my pleasure. And
&hellip; I&rsquo;ll put no flowers in mamma&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theo grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; whispered Doddie, &ldquo;that papa &hellip; eh?
So in love, always. He blushed when he asked me about the
flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theo grinned once more and hummed in unison with the band in the
distance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=

<h2 class="main">Chapter Three</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">Next morning Theo went in the landau to fetch
his step-mother from the station at half-past eleven.</p>
<p>Van Oudijck, who was in the habit of taking the police-cases at that
hour, had made no suggestion to his son; but, when from his office he
saw Theo step into the carriage and drive off, he thought it nice of
the boy. He had idolized Theo as a child, had spoilt him as a lad, had
often come into conflict with him as a young man; but the old paternal
fondness still often flickered up in him, irresistibly. At this moment
he loved his son better than Doddie, who had maintained her sulky
attitude that morning and had put no flowers in his wife&rsquo;s room,
so that he had ordered Kario to see to them. He now felt sorry that he
had not said a kind word to Theo for some days and he resolved to mend
matters at once. The boy was scatter-brained: in three years he had
been employed on at least five different coffee-plantations; now he was
once more without a berth and was hanging around at home, looking out
for something else.</p>
<p>Theo had not long to wait at the station before the train arrived.
He at once saw Mrs. van Oudijck and the two little boys, Ren&eacute;
and Ricus&mdash;two little half-castes, as compared with
himself&mdash;whom she was bringing back from Batavia for the long
holidays, and her maid, Oorip. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27"
href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>Theo helped his step-mother to alight; the station-master offered a
respectful greeting to the wife of his resident. She nodded in return
with her queenly smile. Still smiling, a trifle ambiguously, she
allowed her step-son to kiss her on the cheek. She was a tall woman,
with a fair complexion and fair hair; she had turned thirty and
possessed the languid dignity of women born in Java, daughters of
European parents on both sides. Something about her attracted attention
at once. It was perhaps her white skin, her creamy complexion, her very
light fair hair, her strange grey eyes, which were sometimes a little
pinched and always wore an ambiguous expression, or it might be her
eternal smile, sometimes very sweet and charming and often insufferable
and tiresome. One could never tell at the first sight of her whether
she concealed anything behind that glance, whether there was any depth,
any soul behind it, or whether it was merely her look and her laugh,
both of them slightly equivocal. Soon, however, one perceived an
observant indifference in her smiles, as though there were very little
that she cared for, as though it would hardly matter to her should the
heavens fall, as though she would watch the event with a smile.</p>
<p>Her gait was leisurely. She wore a pink piqu&eacute; skirt and
bolero, a white satin ribbon round her waist and a white sailor-hat
with a white satin bow; and her summer travelling-costume was very
smart, compared with that of a couple of other ladies on the platform,
lounging in stiffly starched washing-frocks that looked like
night-dresses, with tulle hats topped with feathers! And, in her very
European <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>aspect, perhaps that leisurely walk, that languid
dignity was the only Indian characteristic that distinguished her from
a woman newly arrived from Holland.</p>
<p>Theo had given her his arm and she let him lead her to the carriage,
the &ldquo;chariot,&rdquo; followed by the two dark little brothers.
She had been away two months. She had a nod and a smile for the
station-master; she had a nod for the coachman and the groom; and she
took her seat slowly, a languid, fair sultana, still smiling. The three
step-sons followed her into the carriage; the maid rode behind in a
dog-cart. Mrs. van Oudijck looked out once or twice and thought
Labuwangi unchanged. But she said nothing. She turned away slowly,
languidly leaning back. Her face displayed a certain satisfaction, but
especially that radiant, laughing indifference, as though nothing could
harm her, as though she were protected by a mysterious force. There was
something strong about this woman, something powerful in her sheer
indifference; there was something invulnerable about her. She looked as
though life would have no hold on her, neither on her complexion nor on
her soul. She looked as though she were incapable of suffering; and it
seemed as though she smiled and were thus contented because no
sickness, no suffering, no poverty, no misery existed for her. An
irradiation of glittering egoism encompassed her. And yet she was, for
the most part, lovable. She was charming and prepossessing because she
was so pretty. This woman, with her sparkling self-satisfaction, was
loved, whatever people might say about her. When she spoke, when she
laughed, she was disarming and, even <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>more, engaging. This was
despite, and, perhaps, just because of her unfathomable indifference.
She took an interest only in her own body and her own soul: everything
else, everything, was totally indifferent to her. Unable to give
anything of her soul, she was incapable of feeling save for herself,
but she smiled so peacefully and enchantingly that she was always
thought lovable, adorable. It was perhaps because of the contour of her
cheeks, the strange ambiguity of her glance, her ineffaceable smile,
the elegance of her figure, the tone of her voice and her knack of
always hitting on the right word. If at first one thought her
insufferable, she did not notice it and simply made herself absolutely
charming. If anyone was jealous, she did not notice it and just
praised, intuitively, indifferently&mdash;for she did not care in the
least&mdash;something in which that other had thought herself
deficient. She could admire with the sweetest expression on her face a
dress which she thought hideous; and, because she was so completely
indifferent, she betrayed no insincerity afterwards and did not gainsay
her admiration. Her vital power was her boundless indifference. She had
accustomed herself to do everything that she felt inclined to do, but
she smiled as she did it; and, however people might talk behind her
back, she remained so correct in her behaviour, so bewitching, that
they forgave her. She was not loved while she was not seen; but so soon
as people saw her, she had won back all that she had lost. Her husband
worshipped her; her step-children&mdash;she had no children of her
own&mdash;could not help being fond of her, despite themselves; her
servants were all under the influence of her charm. She never grumbled;
she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>gave an order with a word and the thing was done.
If something went wrong, if something was broken, her smile died away
for a moment &hellip; and that was all. And if her own moral or
physical interests were in danger, she was generally able to avoid the
danger and settle things to her advantage, without even allowing her
smile to fade. But she had gathered this personal interest so closely
about her that she could usually control its circumstances. No destiny
seemed to weigh upon this woman. Her indifference was radiant, was
absolutely indifferent, devoid of contempt, or envy, or emotion: it was
merely indifference. And the tact with which, instinctively, without
ever giving much thought to it, she guided and ruled her life was so
great that possibly if she had lost everything that she now
possessed&mdash;her beauty, her position, for instance&mdash;she would
still contrive to remain indifferent, in her incapacity for
suffering.</p>
<p>The carriage drove into the residency-grounds just as the police
cases were beginning. The native assessor was already with Van Oudijck
in the office; the chief constable and the police led the procession of
the accused; the natives tripped along, holding on to the corners of
one another&rsquo;s jackets; but the few women among them walked alone.
They all squatted in waiting under a banyan tree, at a short distance
from the steps of the office. A messenger, hearing the clock in the
verandah, struck half-past twelve on the great bell by the lodge. The
loud stroke reverberated like a brazen voice through the scorching
mid-day heat. But Van Oudijck had heard the sound of the
carriage-wheels and let the native magistrate wait: he went to welcome
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>wife. His face brightened; he kissed her tenderly,
effusively, asked how she was. He was glad to see the boys back. And,
remembering what he had been thinking about Theo, he found a kind word
for his first-born. Doddie, her little mouth still pouting and sulky,
kissed mamma. Mrs. van Oudijck allowed herself to be kissed,
resignedly, smilingly; she returned the kisses calmly, without coldness
or warmth, just doing what she had to do. Her husband, Theo and Doddie
admired her perceptibly, and audibly said that she was looking well;
Doddie asked where mamma had got that pretty travelling-dress. In her
room she noticed the flowers, and, as she knew that Van Oudijck always
saw to these, she gently stroked his arm.</p>
<p>The resident went back to his office, where the assessor was
waiting; the hearing began. Pushed along by a policeman, the accused
came one by one and squatted on the steps, outside the office-door,
while the assessor squatted on a mat and the resident sat at his
writing-table. During the first case, Van Oudijck was still listening
to his wife&rsquo;s voice in the middle gallery, when the prisoner,
defending himself, gave a loud cry of:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The resident knitted his brows and listened
attentively&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The voice in the middle gallery ceased. Mrs. van Oudijck had gone to
take off her things and put on her native dress for lunch. She wore the
dress gracefully: a Solo sarong, a transparent kabaai, jewelled pins,
white leather slippers with a little white bow. She was just ready when
Doddie came to her door and said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32"
href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma! Mamma!&hellip; Mrs. van Does is here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile died away for a moment; the soft eyes looked dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come at once, dear&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she sat down instead; Oorip, the maid, sprinkled some scent on
her handkerchief. Mrs. van Oudijck put up her feet and lay musing,
after the fatigue of her journey. She found Labuwangi desperately dull
after Batavia, where she had spent two months staying with relations
and friends, free and untrammelled by obligations. Here, as the wife of
the resident, she had certain duties, though she delegated most of them
to the secretary&rsquo;s wife. She felt tired in herself, out of sorts,
dissatisfied. Despite her complete indifference, she was human enough
to have her silent moods, in which she wished everything at the bottom
of the sea. At one time she suddenly longed to do something mad, at
another she vaguely longed for Paris&#8202;&hellip;. She would never
let any one see all this. She was able to control herself; and she
controlled herself now, before making her appearance again. Her vague
Bacchanalian longings melted away in her fatigue. She stretched herself
out at greater ease. She mused, with eyes almost closed. Through her
almost superhuman indifference a curious fancy sometimes crept, hidden
from the world. She preferred to live in her bedroom her life of
fragrant imagination, especially after her month in Batavia. After one
of those months of perversity, she felt a need to let her vagrant, rosy
imaginings rise like a whirling mist before her half-closed eyes. There
was in her otherwise utterly barren soul as it were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>an
unnatural growth of little azure flowers, which she cherished with the
only feeling that she could ever experience. She felt for no living
creature, but she felt for those little flowers. It was delicious to
dream like this of what she would have liked to be if she were not
compelled to be what she was. Her fancies rose in a whirling mist: she
saw a white palace, with little cupids everywhere&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma &hellip; do come! Mrs. van Does is here, Mrs. van Does,
with two stoppered bottles&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Doddie, at the door. L&eacute;onie van Oudijck stood up and
went to the back verandah, where the Indian lady was sitting, the wife
of the postmaster. She kept cows and sold milk. But she also drove
other trades. She was a stout woman, rather dark-skinned, with a
prominent stomach; she wore a very simple little kabaai with a narrow
band of lace round it; and she sat stroking her stomach with her fat
hands. In front of her, on the table, stood two small phials, with
something glittering in them. What was it, Mrs. van Oudijck wondered:
sugar, crystals? Then she suddenly remembered&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Mrs. van Does said that she was glad to see her again. Two months
away from Labuwangi. Too bad, Mrs. van Oudijck! And she pointed to the
bottles. Mrs. van Oudijck smiled. What was inside them?</p>
<p>With a great air of mystery, Mrs. van Does laid a fat,
double-jointed forefinger on one of the jam-pots and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diamonds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, really?&rdquo; said Mrs. van Oudijck.</p>
<p>Doddie, wide-eyed, and Theo, greatly amused stared at the stoppered
bottles. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes &hellip; you know &hellip; that lady&rsquo;s, of whom I
spoke to you&#8202;&hellip;. She doesn&rsquo;t want her name mentioned.
Poor thing, her husband once a great swell &hellip; and now &hellip;
yes, so unfortunate; she has nothing left! All gone. Only these two
little bottles. Had all her jewels unset and keeps the stones in the
bottles. All counted. She trusts them to me to sell. Know her through
my milk-business. Will you look at, Mrs. van Oudijck, yes?
<i>Lovely</i> stones! The <i>resid&egrave;n</i> he buy for you, now you
back home again. Doddie, give me a bit of black stuff: velvet
best&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doddie sent the seamstress to fetch a bit of black velvet from a
cupboard of odds and ends. A boy brought glasses with tamarind-syrup
and ice. Mrs. van Does, holding a little pair of tongs in her
double-jointed fingers, laid a couple of stones carefully on the
velvet:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Look at that water, mevrouw!
Ser-per-len-did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. van Oudijck looked on. She gave her most charming smile and
then said, in her gentle voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That stone is not real, dear mevrouw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not real?&rdquo; screamed Mrs. van Does. &ldquo;Not
real?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. van Oudijck looked at the other stones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And those others, mevrouw,&rdquo; stooping attentively: then,
in her most charming tones, &ldquo;those others &hellip; they too are
paste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. van Does looked at her with delight. Then she said to Doddie
and Theo, archly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That mamma of yours &hellip; oh, so shrewd! She sees at
once!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span></p>
<p>And she laughed aloud. They all laughed. Mrs. van Does returned the
stones to the bottle:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A joke, yes, mevrouw? I only wanted to see if you understood.
I give you my word, of course: I should never have sold them to
you&#8202;&hellip;. But there &hellip; look!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now solemnly, almost religiously, she opened the other little
phial, which contained only a few stones, and placed them lovingly on
the black velvet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one would be splendid &hellip; for a pendant,&rdquo;
said Mrs. van Oudijck, gazing at a very large brilliant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, what did I tell you?&rdquo; said the Indian lady.</p>
<p>And they all gazed at the diamonds, at the real ones, which came out
of the &ldquo;real&rdquo; bottle, and held them up carefully to the
light.</p>
<p>Mrs. van Oudijck saw that they were all real:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really have no money, dear mevrouw!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This big one &hellip; for a pendant &hellip; six hundred
guilders.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e761src" href="#xd26e761" name=
"xd26e761src">1</a> &hellip; A bargain, I assure you,
mevrouw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mevrouw, never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much then? You are doing a charity if you buy. Poor
thing, her husband once a great swell, Indian Council.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! What next? Two hundred guilders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred and fifty, but no more. I really have no
money.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>resid&egrave;n</i>!&rdquo; whispered Mrs. van Does,
catching sight of Van Oudijck, who, now that the cases were finished,
was coming to the back verandah. &ldquo;The <i>resid&egrave;n</i>
&hellip; he buy for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. van Oudijck smiled and looked at the sparkling drop of light on
the black velvet. She liked jewels, she was not altogether indifferent
to diamonds. And she looked at her husband:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. van Does is showing us a lot of beautiful things,&rdquo;
she said, caressingly.</p>
<p>Van Oudijck felt an inward shock. He was never pleased to see Mrs.
van Does in his house. She always had something to sell: at one time,
richly embroidered counterpanes; at another time, a pair of woven
slippers; at another, magnificent but very expensive table-slips, with
golden flowers in <i>batik</i> on yellow glazed linen. Mrs. van Does
always brought something with her, was always in touch with the wives
of erstwhile &ldquo;great swells,&rdquo; whom she helped by selling
their things for a very high commission. A morning call from Mrs. van
Does cost him each time at least a few rix-dollars and very often fifty
guilders, for his wife had a calm habit of always buying things which
she did not need but which she was too indifferent to refuse to buy of
Mrs. van Does. He did not see the two bottles at once, but he saw the
drop of light on the black velvet and he understood that the visit
would cost him more than fifty guilders this time, unless he was very
firm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mevrouwtje!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in dismay. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the end of the month: there&rsquo;s no question of buying diamonds
to-day! And bottles full too!&rdquo; he added, with a stare, when he
now saw them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>glittering on the table, among the glasses of
tamarind-syrup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that <i>resid&egrave;n</i>!&rdquo; laughed Mrs. van Does,
as though a resident were bound to be always well off.</p>
<p>Van Oudijck hated that little laugh. His household cost him every
month a few odd hundred guilders above his salary; and he was living
beyond his income, was in debt. His wife never troubled herself with
money matters; for these more especially she reserved her most smiling
indifference.</p>
<p>She made the diamond sparkle in the sun and shoot forth a blue
ray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beauty &hellip; for two hundred and
fifty,&rdquo; said Mrs. van Oudijck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For three hundred then, dear
mevrouw&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hundred?&rdquo; she asked, dreamily, playing with the
gem.</p>
<p>Whether it cost three hundred or four or five hundred was all one to
her. It left her wholly indifferent. But she liked the stone and meant
to have it, at whatever price. And therefore she quietly put the stone
down and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear mevrouw, really &hellip; it&rsquo;s too expensive;
and my husband has no money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said it so prettily that there was no guessing her intention.
She was adorably self-sacrificing as she spoke the words. Van Oudijck
felt a second inward shock. He could refuse his wife nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mevrouw,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you can leave the stone
&hellip; for three hundred guilders. But for God&rsquo;s sake take your
bottles away with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. van Does looked up delightedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, what did I tell you? I knew for certain the
<i>resid&egrave;n</i> would buy for you!&hellip;&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mrs. van Oudijck looked up in gentle reproach:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Otto!&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;How <i>can</i>
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like the stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s beautiful&#8202;&hellip;. But such a lot of
money! For one diamond!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she drew her husband&rsquo;s hand towards her and suffered him
to kiss her on the forehead, because he had been permitted to buy her a
three-hundred-guilder diamond. Doddie and Theo stood winking at each
other. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">L&eacute;onie Van Oudijck always enjoyed her
siesta. She only slept for a moment, but she loved after lunch to be
alone in her cool bedroom till five or half-past five. She read a
little, mostly the magazines from the circulating library, but as a
rule she did nothing but dream. Her dreams were vague imaginings, which
rose before her as in an azure mist during her afternoons of solitude.
Nobody knew of them and she kept them very secret, like a secret vice,
a sin. She committed herself much more readily&mdash;to the
world&mdash;where her <i>liaisons</i> were concerned. These never
lasted long; they counted for little in her life; she never wrote
letters; and the favours which she granted afforded the recipient no
privileges in the daily intercourse of society. Hers was a silent,
correct depravity, both physical and moral. For her imaginings too,
despite their poetical insipidity, were depraved. Her pet author was
Catulle Mend&egrave;s: she loved all those little flowers of azure
sentimentality, those rosy, affected little cupids, with one little
finger in the air and their legs gracefully hovering around the most
vicious themes and motives of perverted passion. In her bedroom hung a
few engravings: a young woman lying on a lace-covered bed and being
kissed by two sportive angels; another: a lion with an arrow through
its breast at the feet of a smiling maiden; lastly, a large coloured
advertisement of some scent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href=
"#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>or other: a sort of floral nymph
whose veils were being drawn on either side by playful little cherubs,
of the kind which we see on soap-boxes. This &ldquo;picture&rdquo; in
particular she thought splendid; she could imagine nothing with a
greater &aelig;sthetic appeal. She knew that the plate was monstrous,
but she had never been able to prevail upon herself to take the
horrible thing down, though it was looked at askance by everybody: her
friends, her step-children, all of whom walked in and out of her room
with the Indian casualness which makes no secret of the toilet. She
could stare at it for minutes on end, as though bewitched; she thought
it perfectly charming; and her own dreams resembled this print. She
also treasured a chocolate-box with a keepsake picture on it, as the
type of beauty which she admired, even above her own: the pink flush on
the cheeks, the brown eyes under unconvincing golden hair, the bosom
showing through the lace. But she never committed herself in respect of
this absurdity, which she vaguely suspected; she never spoke of these
prints and boxes, just because she knew that actually they were
hideous. But <i>she</i> thought them lovely; for her they were
delightful, were artistic and poetical.</p>
<p>These were her happiest hours.</p>
<p>Here, at Labuwangi, she dared not do what she did in Batavia; and
here, at Labuwangi, people hardly believed what people in Batavia said.
Nevertheless, Mrs. van Does averred that this resident and that
inspector&mdash;the one travelling for his pleasure, the other on an
official circuit&mdash;staying for a few days at the residency, had
found their way in the afternoon, during the siesta, to
L&eacute;onie&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41"
name="pb41">41</a>]</span>bedroom. But all the same at Labuwangi any
such actual occurrences were the rarest of interludes between Mrs. van
Oudijck&rsquo;s rosy afternoon visions.</p>
<p>Still, this afternoon it seemed as though, after dozing a little
while and after all the dullness caused by the journey and the heat had
cleared away from her milk-white complexion&mdash;it seemed, now that
she was looking at the romping angels of the scent-advertisement, that
her thoughts were no longer dwelling on those rosy, tender, doll-like
forms, but as though she were listening to the sounds
outside&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>She was wearing nothing but a sarong, which she had pulled up under
her arms and hitched in a twist across her breast. Her beautiful fair
hair hung loose. Her pretty little white feet were bare: she had not
even put on her slippers. And she looked through the slats of the
shutters.</p>
<p>Between the flower-pots, which, standing on the side steps of the
house, masked her windows with great masses of foliage, she could see
an annexe consisting of four rooms, the spare-rooms, one of which was
Theo&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>She stood peering for a moment and then set the shutter ajar. And
she saw that the shutter of Theo&rsquo;s room also opened a little
way&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Then she smiled; she knotted her sarong more closely and lay down
upon the bed again.</p>
<p>She listened.</p>
<p>In a moment she heard the gravel grating slightly under the pressure
of a slipper. Her shutters, without being closed, were drawn to. A hand
now opened them cautiously&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>She looked round smiling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Theo?&rdquo; she asked. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span></p>
<p>He came nearer. He was dressed in pyjamas and he sat on the edge of
the bed and played with her soft white hands and suddenly he kissed her
fiercely.</p>
<p>At that instant a stone whizzed through the bedroom.</p>
<p>They both started, looked up, and in a moment were both standing in
the middle of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who threw that?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the boys, perhaps,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Ren&eacute;
or Ricus, playing about outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t up yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or something may have fallen from
above&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was thrown&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stone so often gets loose&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is gravel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She picked up the little stone. He looked outside cautiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, L&eacute;onie. It must really have fallen
out of the gutter &hellip; and then bounced up again. It&rsquo;s
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m frightened,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>He laughed almost aloud and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had nothing to fear. The room lay between L&eacute;onie&rsquo;s
boudoir and two large spare-rooms, which were reserved exclusively for
residents, generals and other highly-placed officials. On the other
side of the middle gallery were Van Oudijck&rsquo;s rooms&mdash;his
office and his bedroom&mdash;and Doddie&rsquo;s room and the room of
the boys, Ricus and Ren&eacute;. L&eacute;onie was therefore isolated
in her wing, between the spare-rooms. It made her cynically insolent.
At this hour, the grounds were quite deserted. For that matter, she was
not afraid of the servants. Oorip <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43"
href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>was wholly to be trusted and
often received handsome presents: sarongs; a gold clasp; a long diamond
kabaai-pin, which she wore as a jewelled silver plaque on her breast.
As L&eacute;onie never grumbled, was generous in advancing wages and
displayed an apparently easy-going temperament&mdash;although
everything always happened as she wished&mdash;she was not disliked;
and, whatever the servants might know about her, they had never yet
betrayed her. It made her all the more insolent. A curtain hung before
a passage between her bedroom and boudoir; and it was arranged, once
and for all, between Theo and L&eacute;onie, that at the least danger
he would slip away quietly behind this hanging, go out through the
garden-door of the boudoir and pretend to be looking at the rose-trees
in the pots on the steps. This would make it appear as though he had
just come from his own room and were merely inspecting the roses. The
inner doors of the boudoir and bedroom were usually locked, because
L&eacute;onie declared frankly that she did not like to be interrupted
unawares.</p>
<p>She liked Theo, because of his fresh youthfulness. And here, at
Labuwangi, he was her only vice, not counting a passing inspector and
the little pink angels. The two were now like naughty children; they
laughed silently, in each other&rsquo;s arms. It was past four by this
time; and they heard the voices of Ren&eacute; and Ricus in the garden.
They were taking possession of the grounds for the holidays. They were
thirteen and fourteen years old; and they revelled in the garden. They
ran about barefoot, in blue striped pyjamas, and went to look at the
horses, at the pigeons; they teased Doddie&rsquo;s cockatoo,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>which tripped about on the roof of the outhouses.
They had a tame squirrel. They hunted geckos, those large-headed
lizards, which they shot with a blow-pipe, to the great vexation of the
servants, because the geckos bring luck. They bought roasted
monkey-nuts at the gate of a passing Chinaman and then mocked him,
imitating his accent, his difficulty with his r&rsquo;s:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loasted monkey-nuts!&hellip; Chinaman
<i>kaput</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They climbed into the flamboyant and swung in the branches like
monkeys. They flung stones at the cats; they incited the
neighbour&rsquo;s dogs to bark themselves hoarse and bite one
another&rsquo;s ears to pieces. They splashed about with the water in
the pond, made themselves unpresentable with mud and dirt and dared to
pluck the Victoria Regias, which was strictly forbidden. They tested
the bearing-power of the flat, green Victoria-leaves, which looked like
tea-trays, and tried to stand on them and tumbled in. Then they took
empty bottles, set them in a row and bowled at them with rounded
flints. Then, with bamboos, they fished up all sorts of unspeakable
floating things from the ditch beside the house and threw them at each
other. Their inventive fancy was inexhaustible; and the hour of the
siesta was their special hour. They had caught a gecko and a cat and
were making them fight each other; the gecko opened its jaws, which
were like a small crocodile&rsquo;s, and hypnotized the cat, which
slunk away, withdrawing from its enemy&rsquo;s beady, black eyes,
arching its back and bristling with terror. And after that the boys ate
themselves ill with unripe mangoes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45"
href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span></p>
<p>L&eacute;onie and Theo had watched the fight between the cat and
gecko through the slats of the shutter and now saw the boys quietly
eating the unripe mangoes on the grass. But it was now the hour when
the prisoners, twelve in number, worked in the grounds, under the
supervision of a dignified old native overseer, with a little cane in
his hand. They fetched water in tubs and watering-cans made out of
paraffin-tins, sometimes in the actual paraffin-tins themselves, and
watered the plants, the grass and the gravel. Then they swept the
grounds with a loud rustle of coco-nut-fibre brooms.</p>
<p>Ren&eacute; and Ricus, behind the overseer&rsquo;s back, for they
were afraid of him, threw half-eaten mangoes at the prisoners and
called them names and made faces and grimaces at them. Doddie appeared
after her nap, carrying her cockatoo on her wrist. It cried,
&ldquo;Kaka! Ka-ka!&rdquo; and raised its yellow crest with swift
movements of its neck.</p>
<p>And Theo now stole behind the curtain into the boudoir, and, at a
moment when the boys were running and bombarding each other with
mangoes, and when Doddie was strolling towards the pond with the
loitering gait and the swing of the hips peculiar to the Creole, he
came from behind the plants, smelling at the roses and behaving as
though he had been walking in the garden before going to take his bath.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">Van Oudijck felt in a more pleasant mood than
he had done for weeks: his house seemed to have recovered after those
two months of dull boredom; he thought it jolly to see his two rascals
of boys romping round the garden, even though they did all sorts of
mischief; and above all he was very glad that his wife was back.</p>
<p>They were now sitting in the garden, in undress, drinking tea, at
half-past five. It was very strange, but L&eacute;onie at once filled
the great house with a certain home-like feeling of comfort, because
she liked comfort herself. At other times Van Oudijck would hurriedly
swallow a cup of tea which Kario brought him in his bedroom: to-day
this afternoon tea made a pleasant break in the day; cane chairs and
long deck-chairs were placed outside, in front of the house; the
tea-tray stood on a cane table; there were roasted bananas; and
L&eacute;onie, in a red silk Japanese kimono, with her fair hair
hanging loose, lay back in a cane chair playing with Doddie&rsquo;s
cockatoo and feeding it with pastry. It was different at once, Van
Oudijck thought: his wife, so sociable, charming, pretty, telling
scraps of news about their friends in Batavia, the races at Buitenzorg,
a ball at the Viceroy&rsquo;s, the Italian opera; the boys merry,
healthy and jolly, however dirty they might make themselves in playing.
He called them to him and romped with them and asked them about the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>grammar-school&mdash;they were both in the second
class&mdash;and even Doddie and Theo seemed different to him: Doddie
was now plucking roses from the potted trees, looking delightfully
pretty and humming a tune; and Theo was communicative with mamma and
even with him. A pleased expression played around Van Oudijck&rsquo;s
moustache. His face was quite young still; he hardly looked
forty-eight. He had a quick, bright glance, a way of looking up
suddenly with an acute, penetrating air. He was rather heavy of build,
with a tendency to become still heavier, but yet he had retained a
soldierly briskness and he was indefatigable on his circuits: he was a
first-rate horseman. Tall and powerfully built, content with his house
and his family, he wore a pleasant air of robust virility, with a
jovial laughing expression around his moustache. And, relaxing himself,
stretched out at full length in his cane chair, he drank his cup of
tea, and gave utterance to the thoughts which generally welled up in
him at such moments of satisfaction. Yes, it was not a bad life in
India,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e947src" href="#xd26e947" name=
"xd26e947src">1</a> when all was said, in the B.B.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e950src" href="#xd26e950" name="xd26e950src">2</a> At least it
had always been good for him; but then he had been pretty lucky.
Promotion nowadays was a desperate business: he knew any number of
assistant-residents who were his contemporaries and who had no chance
of becoming residents for years to come. And that certainly was a
desperate position, to continue so long in a subordinate office, to be
compelled at that age to hold one&rsquo;s self at the orders of a
resident. He could never <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href=
"#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>have stood it, at forty-eight! But to
be a resident, to give orders on his own initiative, to rule as large
and important a district as Labuwangi, with such extensive
coffee-plantations, with such numbers of sugar-factories, with so many
leased concessions: that was a delight, that was living, that was a
life grander and more spacious than any other, a life with which no
life or position in Holland was to be compared. His great
responsibility delighted his authoritative nature. His activities were
varied: office work and circuit; the interest of his work varied: a man
was not bored to death in his office-chair; after the office there was
out-of-door life; and there was always a change, always something
different. He hoped in eighteen months to become a resident of the
first class, if a first-class residency fell vacant: Batavia, Samarang,
Surabaya, or one of the Vorstenlanden.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e958src" href="#xd26e958" name="xd26e958src">3</a> And yet it
would go to his heart to leave Labuwangi. He was attached to his
district, for which he had done so much during the past five years,
which in those five years had attained its highest prosperity, in so
far as prosperity was possible in these times of general depression,
with the colonies poor, the population impoverished, the coffee-crops
worse than ever, sugar perhaps threatened with a serious crisis in two
years&rsquo; time. India was in a languishing condition; and even in
the industrial eastern portion of the island inertia and lack of
vitality were spreading like a blight; but still he had been able to do
much for Labuwangi. During his administration the people had thrived
and prospered; the irrigation of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>corn-fields was
excellent, after he had succeeded in tactfully winning over the
engineer, who at first was always in conflict with the B.B. Miles and
miles of steam tramway had been laid down. The secretary, his
assistant-residents and controllers were his willing coadjutors, though
he kept them hard at work. But he had a pleasant way with them, even
though the work was hard. He knew how to be jolly and friendly with
them, resident though he was. He was glad that all of
them&mdash;controllers and assistant-residents&mdash;represented the
wholesome, cheerful type of B.B. official, pleased with their life,
liking their work, though nowadays given much more than formerly to
studying the <i>Government Almanack</i> and the <i>Colonial List</i>
with an eye to their promotion. And it was Van Oudijck&rsquo;s hobby to
compare his officials with the judicial functionaries, who did not
represent the same alert type: there was always a slight jealousy and
animosity between the two orders&#8202;&hellip;. Yes, it was a pleasant
life, a pleasant sphere of activity: everything was all right. There
was nothing to beat the B.B. His only regret was that his relations
with the regent<a class="noteref" id="xd26e973src" href="#xd26e973"
name="xd26e973src">4</a> were not easier and more agreeable. But it was
not his fault. He had always very conscientiously given the regent his
due, had left him in the enjoyment of his full rights, had seen to it
that he was duly respected by the Javanese population and even by the
European officials. Oh, how intensely he regretted the death of the old
pang&eacute;ran, the regent&rsquo;s father; the old regent, a noble,
cultivated Javanese! Van Oudijck had always been in sympathy with him,
had at once won him by his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href=
"#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>tact. Had he not, five years ago,
when he arrived at Labuwangi to take over the administration, invited
the pang&eacute;ran&mdash;the type of the genuine Javanese
noble&mdash;to sit beside him in his own carriage, rather than allow
him to follow in a second carriage, behind the resident&rsquo;s
carriage, as was usual? And had not this civility toward the old prince
at once won all the Javanese heads and officials and flattered them in
their respect and love for their regent, the descendant of one of the
oldest Javanese families, the Adiningrats, who were Sultans of Madura
in the Company&rsquo;s time?&hellip; But Sunario, his son, now the
young regent, he was unable to understand, unable to fathom. This he
confessed only to himself, in silence, seeing him always
enigmatic&mdash;that marionette, that puppet, as he called
him&mdash;always stiff, keeping his distance towards him, the resident,
as though he, the prince, looked down upon him, the Dutch burgher, and
wholly absorbed in all sorts of superstitious observances and fanatical
speculations. He never said as much openly, but something in the regent
escaped him. He was unable to place that delicate figure, with the
fixed, coal-black eyes, in the practical life of human beings, as he
had always been able to place the old pang&eacute;ran. The latter had
always been to him, in accordance with his age, a fatherly friend; in
accordance with etiquette, his &ldquo;younger brother&rdquo;; but
always the fellow-ruler of his district. But Sunario seemed to him
unreal, not a functionary, not a regent, merely a fanatical Javanese
who always shrouded himself in mystery:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such nonsense!&rdquo; thought Van Oudijck.</p>
<p>He laughed at the reputation for sacrosanctity <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>which
the populace bestowed upon Sunario. He thought him unpractical, a
degenerate Javanese, a crazy Javanese dandy.</p>
<p>But his lack of harmony with the regent&mdash;a lack of harmony in
character only, which had never developed into actual fact: why, he
could twist the mannikin round his finger!&mdash;was the only great
difficulty which had arisen during all these years. And he would not
have exchanged his life as a resident for any other life whatever. Why,
he was already fretting about what he would do later, when he was
pensioned off! What he would have preferred was to continue as long as
possible in the service, as a member of the Indian Council, as
vice-president of the Council. The object of his unspoken ambition, in
the far-away future, was the throne of Buitenzorg. But nowadays they
had that strange mania in Holland for appointing outsiders to the
highest posts&mdash;men sent straight from Holland, newcomers who knew
nothing about India&mdash;instead of remaining faithful to the
principle of selecting old Indian servants, who had made their way up
from subcontroller and who knew the whole official hierarchy by
heart&#8202;&hellip;. Yes, what would he do, pensioned off? Live at
Nice? With no money? For saving was impracticable: his life was
comfortable, but expensive; and instead of saving he was running up
debts. Well, that didn&rsquo;t matter now: the debts would be paid off
in time, but later, later&#8202;&hellip;. The future, the existence of
a pensioned official, was anything but an agreeable prospect for him.
To vegetate at the Hague, in a small house, with a gin-and-bitters at
the club, among the old fogeys: br-r-r! The very idea of it made him
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>shudder. He wouldn&rsquo;t think about it; he
preferred not to think about it at all: perhaps he would be dead by
that time. But it was all delightful now: his work, his house, India.
There was absolutely nothing to compare with it.</p>
<p>L&eacute;onie had listened to him smilingly: she was accustomed to
his quiet enthusiasm, his rhapsodizing over his post; as she put it,
his adoration of the B.B. She also valued the luxury of being a
resident&rsquo;s wife. The comparative isolation she did not mind; she
usually was sufficient unto herself. And she answered smilingly,
contented and charming with her creamy complexion, which showed still
whiter under the light coat of rice-powder against the red silk of her
kimono and looked so delightful amidst the surrounding waves of her
fair hair.</p>
<p>That morning she had felt put out for a moment: Labuwangi, after
Batavia, had depressed her with the tedium of an up-country capital.
But since then she had acquired a large diamond; since then she had got
Theo back. His room was close to hers. And it was sure to be a long
time before he could obtain a berth.</p>
<p>These were her thoughts, while her husband sat blissfully reflecting
after his pleasant confidences.</p>
<p>Her thoughts went no deeper than this: anything like remorse would
have surprised her in the highest degree, had she been capable of
feeling it. It began to grow dark slowly; the moon was already rising
and shining brightly; and behind the velvety banyans, behind the
feathery boughs of the coco-palms, which waved gently up and down like
stately sheaves of dark ostrich-feathers, the last light of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>sun cast a faintly stippled, dull-gold reflection,
against which the softness of the banyans and the pomp of the
coco-palms stood out as though etched in black. From the distance came
the monotonous tinkle of the native orchestra, mournfully, limpid as
water, like a xylophone, with a deep dissonance at
intervals&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">Van Oudijck, in a pleasant mood because of his
wife and children, suggested a drive; and the horses were put to the
landau. Van Oudijck had a pleased and jovial look, under the broad,
gold-laced peak of his cap. L&eacute;onie, seated beside him, was
wearing a new mauve muslin frock, from Batavia, and a hat with mauve
poppies. A lady&rsquo;s hat in the up-country districts is a luxury, a
colossal elegance; and Doddie, facing her, but dressed inland fashion,
without a hat, was secretly vexed and thought that mamma might just as
well have told her she was going to &ldquo;take&rdquo; a hat, to use
Doddie&rsquo;s idiom. She now looked such a contrast to mamma; she
couldn&rsquo;t stand them now, those softly swaying poppies. Of the
boys, Ren&eacute; was with them, in a clean white suit. The chief
messenger sat on the box beside the coachman, holding against his side
the great golden umbrella, the symbol of authority. It was past six, it
was already growing dark; and over Labuwangi there hung at this hour
the velvety silence, the tragic mystery of the twilit atmosphere that
marked the days of the eastern monsoon. Sometimes a dog barked, or a
wood-pigeon cooed, breaking the unreality of the silence, as of a
deserted town. But now there was also the rattle of the carriage
driving right through the silence; and the horses stamped the silence
into tiny shreds. No other carriages were met; an absence of all
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>signs of human life cast a spell upon the gardens
and verandahs. A couple of young men on foot, in white, took off their
hats.</p>
<p>The carriage had left the wealthier part of the town and entered the
Chinese quarter, where the lights were burning in the little shops.
Business was almost finished: the Chinamen were resting, in all sorts
of limp attitudes, with their legs dangling or crossed, their arms
round their heads, their pigtails loose or twisted around their skulls.
When the carriage approached, they rose and remained standing
respectfully. The Javanese for the most part&mdash;those who were well
brought up and knew their manners&mdash;squatted. Along the road stood
the little portable kitchens, lit by small paraffin lamps, of the
drink-vendors and pastry-sellers. The motley colours showed dingy in
the evening darkness, lit by innumerable little lamps. The Chinese
shops, crammed with goods, displayed red and gold signboards and red
and gold placards with inscriptions; in the background was the domestic
altar with the sacred print; the white god seated, with the black god
grimacing behind him. But the street widened, became suddenly more
considerable: rich Chinese houses loomed white in the dusk; the most
striking was the gleaming, palatial villa of an immensely wealthy
retired opium-factor, who had made his money in the days before the
opium monopoly: a gleaming palace of graceful stucco-work with
numberless outbuildings. The porticos of the verandah were in a
monumental style of imposing elegance and in many soft shades of gold;
in the depth of the open house the immense domestic altar was visible,
with the print of the gods <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=
"#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>conspicuously illuminated; the garden
was laid out with conventional winding paths, but beautifully filled
with square pots and tall vases of dark blue-and-green glazed
porcelain, containing dwarf trees, handed down as heirlooms from father
to son; and all was kept with a radiant cleanliness, a careful neatness
of detail, eloquent of the prosperous, spick-and-span luxury of a
Chinese opium-millionaire. But not all the Chinese houses were so
ostentatiously open: most of them lay hidden with closed doors in
high-walled gardens, tucked away in the secrecy of their domestic
life.</p>
<p>But suddenly the houses came to an end and Chinese graves stretched
along a broad road, rich graves, each grassy mound with a stone
entrance&mdash;the door of death&mdash;raised in the form of the symbol
of fecundity&mdash;the door of life&mdash;and all surrounded with a
wide space of turf, to the great vexation of Van Oudijck, who reckoned
out how much ground was lost to cultivation by these burial-places of
the wealthy Chinese. And the Chinese seemed to triumph in life and
death in this mysterious town which was otherwise so silent; the
Chinese gave it its real character of busy traffic, of trade, of
money-making, of living and dying; for, when the carriage drove into
the Arab quarter&mdash;a district of ordinary houses, but gloomy,
lacking in style, with life and prosperity hidden away behind closed
doors; with chairs in the verandah, but the master of the house
gloomily sitting cross-legged on the floor, following the carriage with
a black look&mdash;this quarter seemed even more mysterious than the
fashionable part of Labuwangi and seemed to radiate its unutterable
mystery like an atmosphere of Islam that spread <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>over the
whole town, as though it were Islam that had poured forth the dusky,
fatal melancholy of resignation which filled the shuddering, noiseless
evening&#8202;&hellip;. They did not feel this in their rattling
carriage, accustomed to that atmosphere as they were from childhood and
no longer sensitive to the gloomy secret that was like the approach of
a dark force which had always breathed upon them, the foreign rulers
with their creole blood, so that they should never suspect it. Perhaps,
when Van Oudijck now and again read about Pan-Islam in the newspapers,
he was dimly conscious in his deepest thoughts of this dark force, this
gloomy secret. But at moments like the present&mdash;driving with his
wife and children, amidst the rattling of his carriage and the
trampling of his fine Walers; the messenger with the furled umbrella,
which glittered like a furled sun, on the box&mdash;he was too
intensely aware of his individuality, his authoritative, overbearing
nature, to feel anything of the dark secret, to divine anything of the
black peril. And he was now in far too pleasant a mood to feel or see
anything melancholy. In his optimism he did not see even the decline of
his town, which he loved; he was not struck, as they drove past, by the
immense porticoed villas, the witnesses to the prosperity of former
planters, now deserted, neglected, standing in grounds that had run
wild, one of them taken over by a timber-felling company, which allowed
the foreman to live in it and stacked the logs in the front-garden. The
deserted houses gleamed sadly with their pillared porticos, which, amid
the desolate grounds, loomed spectral in the moonlight, like temples of
evil. But they did not see it like that: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>enjoying the rocking of
the smooth carriage-springs, L&eacute;onie smiled and dozed; and
Doddie, now that they were approaching the Lange Laan again, looked out
to see whether she could catch sight of Addie&#8202;&hellip;.

<h2 class="main">Chapter Seven</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">The secretary, Onno Eldersma, was a busy man.
The post brought a daily average of some two hundred letters and
documents to the residency-office, which employed two senior clerks,
six juniors and a number of native writers and clerks; and the resident
grumbled whenever the work fell into arrears. He himself was an
energetic worker; and he expected his subordinates to show the same
spirit. But sometimes there was a perfect torrent of documents, claims
and applications. Eldersma was the typical government official, wholly
wrapped up in his minutes and reports; and Eldersma was always busy. He
worked morning, noon and night. He allowed himself no siesta. He took a
hurried lunch at four o&rsquo;clock and then rested for a little.
Fortunately he had a sound, robust, Frisian constitution; but he needed
all his blood, all his muscles, all his nerves for his work. It was not
mere scribbling, mere fumbling with papers: it was manual labour with
the pen, muscular work, nervous work; and it never ceased. He consumed
himself, he spent himself, he was always writing. He had not another
idea left in his head; he was nothing but the official, the civil
servant. He had a charming house, a most charming and exceptional wife,
a delightful child, but he never saw them, though he lived, vaguely,
amid his home surroundings. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60"
href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>just slaved away,
conscientiously, working off what he could. Sometimes he would tell the
resident that it was impossible for him to do any more. But on this
point Van Oudijck was inexorable, pitiless. He himself had been a
district secretary; he knew what it meant. It meant work, it meant
plodding like a cart-horse. It meant living, eating, sleeping with your
pen in your hand. Then Van Oudijck would show him this or that piece of
work which had to be finished. And Eldersma, who had said that he could
do no more than he was doing, somehow got it done, and therefore always
did do something more than he believed that he could do.</p>
<p>Then his wife, Eva, would say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My husband has ceased to be a human being; my husband has
ceased to be a man; my husband is an official.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young wife, very European, now in India for the first time, had
never known, before her two years at Labuwangi, that it was possible to
work as hard as her husband did, in a country as hot as Labuwangi was
during the eastern moonson. She had resisted it at first; she had at
first tried to stand upon her rights; but once she saw that he really
had not a minute to spare, she waived them. She had very soon come to
realize that her husband could not share her life, nor could she share
his: not because he was not a good husband and very fond of his wife,
but simply because the post brought two hundred letters and documents
daily. She had soon seen that there was nothing for her to do at
Labuwangi and that she would have to console herself with her house
and, later, with her child. She arranged her house as a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>temple
of art and comfort and racked her brains over the education of her
little boy. She was an artistically cultivated woman and came from an
artistic environment. Her father was Van Hove, the great
landscape-painter; her mother was Stella Couberg, the famous
concert-singer. Eva, brought up in an artistic and musical home whose
atmosphere she had breathed since her babyhood, in her picture-books
and childish songs, Eva had married an East-Indian civil servant and
had accompanied him to Labuwangi. She loved her husband, a good-looking
Frisian and a man of sufficient culture to take an interest in many
subjects. And she had gone, happy in her love and filled with illusions
about India and all the Orientalism of the tropics. And she had tried
to preserve her illusions, despite the warnings which she had received.
At Singapore she was struck by the colour of the naked Malays, like
that of a bronze statue, by the Eastern motley of the Chinese and Arab
quarters and the poetry of the Japanese tea-houses, which unfolded like
a page of Loti as she drove past. But, soon after, in Batavia, a grey
disappointment had fallen like a cold, drizzling rain upon her
expectation of seeing everything in India as a beautiful fairy-tale, a
story out of the Arabian Nights. The habits of their narrow, everyday
existence damped all her unsophisticated longing to admire; and she saw
everything that was ridiculous even before she discovered anything else
that was beautiful. At her hotel, the men in pyjamas lay at full length
in their deck-chairs, with their lazy legs on the extended leg-rests,
their feet&mdash;although carefully tended&mdash;bare <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>and
their toes moving quietly in a conscientious exercise of big toe and
little toe, even while she was passing. The ladies were in sarong and
kabaai, the only practical morning-dress, which is easily changed two
or three times a day, but which suits so few, the straight, pillow-case
outline at the back being peculiarly angular and ugly, however elegant
and expensive the costume&#8202;&hellip;. And then the commonplace
aspect of the houses, with all their whitewash and their rows of
fragile and meretricious flower-pots; the parched barrenness of the
vegetation, the dirt of the natives! And, in the life of the Europeans,
all the minor absurdities: the half-caste accent, with the constant
little exclamations; the narrow provincial conventionality of the
officials: only the Indian Council allowed to wear top-hats. And then
the rigorous little maxims of etiquette: at a reception, the highest
functionary is the first to leave; the others follow in due order. And
the little peculiarities of tropical customs, such as the use of
packing-cases and paraffin-tins for this, that and the other purpose:
the wood for shop-windows, for dust-bins and home-made articles of
furniture; the tins for gutters and watering-cans and all kinds of
domestic utensils&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The young and cultured little woman, with her Arabian Nights
illusions, was unable, amid these first impressions, to distinguish
between what was colonial&mdash;the expedients of a European
acclimatizing himself in a country which is alien to his
blood&mdash;and what was really poetic, genuinely Indian, purely
eastern, absolutely Javanese; and, because of these and other little
absurdities, she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>had at once felt disappointed, as every one with
artistic inclinations feels disappointed in colonial India, which is
not at all artistic or poetic and in which the rose-trees in their
white pots are conscientiously manured with horse-droppings as high as
they will bear, so that, when a breeze springs up, the scent of the
roses mingles with a stench of freshly-sprinkled manure. And she had
grown unjust, as does every Hollander, every newcomer to the beautiful
country which he would like to see with the eyes of his preconceived
literary vision, but which impresses him at first by its absurd
colonial side. And she forgot that the country itself, which was
originally so absolutely beautiful, was not to blame for all this
absurdity.</p>
<p>She had had a couple of years of it and had been astonished,
occasionally alarmed, then again shocked, had laughed sometimes and
then again been annoyed; and at last, with the reasonableness of her
nature and the practical side of her artistic soul, had grown
accustomed to it all. She had grown accustomed to the toe-exercises, to
the manure around the roses; she had grown accustomed to her husband,
who was no longer a human being, no longer a man, but an official. She
had suffered a great deal, she had written despairing letters, she had
been sick with longing for the home of her parents, she had been on the
verge of making a sudden departure, but she had not gone, so as not to
leave her husband in his loneliness, and she had accustomed herself to
things and made the best of them. She had not only the soul of an
artist&mdash;she played the piano exceptionally well&mdash;but also the
heart of a plucky little woman. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64"
href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>She had gone on loving her
husband and she felt that, after all, she provided him with a pleasant
home. She gave serious attention to the education of her child. And,
once she had become accustomed to things, she grew less unjust and
suddenly saw much of what was beautiful in India; admired the stately
grace of a coco-palm, the exquisite, <span class="corr" id="xd26e1042"
title="Source: paradisial">paradisal</span> flavour of the Indian
fruits, the glory of the blossoming trees; and, in the inland
districts, she had realized the noble majesty of nature, the harmony of
the undulating hills, the faery forests of gigantic ferns, the menacing
ravines of the craters, the shimmering terraces of the flooded
rice-fields, with the tender green of the young paddy; and the
character of the Javanese had been a very revelation to her: his
elegance, his grace, his salutation, his dancing; his aristocratic
distinction, so often evidently handed down directly from a noble race,
from an age-old chivalry, now modernized into a diplomatic suppleness,
worshipping authority by nature and inevitably resigned under the yoke
of the rulers whose gold-lace arouses his innate respect.</p>
<p>In her father&rsquo;s house, Eva had always felt around her the cult
of the artistic and the beautiful, even to the verge of decadence;
those with her had always directed her attention, in an environment of
perfectly beautiful things, in beautiful words, in music, to the
plastic beauty of life, and perhaps too exclusively to that alone. And
she was now too well-trained in that school of beauty to persist in her
disappointment and to see only the white-wash and flimsiness of the
houses, the petty airs of the officials, the packing-cases and the
horse-droppings. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>Her literary mind now saw the palatial character
of the houses, so typical of the official arrogance, which could hardly
have been other than it was; and she saw all these details more
accurately, obtaining a broader insight into all that world of India,
so that revelation followed upon revelation. Only she continued to feel
something strange, something that she could not analyse, a certain
mystery, a dark secrecy, which she felt creeping softly over the land
at night. But she thought that it was no more than a mood produced by
the darkness and the very dense foliage, that it was like the very
quiet music of stringed instruments of a kind quite strange to her, a
distant murmur of harps in a minor key, a vague voice of warning, a
whispering in the night&mdash;no more&mdash;which evoked poetic
imaginings.</p>
<p>At Labuwangi, a small inland capital, she often astonished the
acclimatized up-country elements because she was somewhat excitable,
because she was enthusiastic, spontaneous, glad to be alive&mdash;even
in India&mdash;glad of the beauty of life, because she had a healthy
nature, softly tempered and shaded into a charming pose of caring for
nothing but the beautiful: beautiful lines, beautiful colours, artistic
ideas. Those who knew her either disliked her or were very fond of her:
few felt indifferent to her. She had gained a reputation in India for
unusualness: her house was unusual, her clothes unusual, the education
of her child unusual; her ideas were unusual and the only ordinary
thing about her was her Frisian husband, who was almost too ordinary in
that environment, which might have been cut out of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>an
art-magazine. She was fond of society and gathered around her as much
of the European element as possible: it was, indeed, seldom artistic;
but she imparted a pleasant tone to it, something that reminded
everybody of Holland. This little clique, this group admired her and
instinctively adopted the tone which she set. Because of her greater
culture, she ruled over it, though she was not a despot by nature. But
they did not all approve of this; and the rest called her eccentric.
The clique, however, the group, remained faithful to her, for she
awakened them, in the soft languor of Indian life, to the existence of
music, ideas, and the <i>joie de vivre</i>. So she had drawn into her
circle the doctor and his wife, the chief engineer and his wife, the
district controller and his wife, and sometimes a couple of outside
controllers, or a few young fellows from the sugar-factories. This
brought round her a gay little band of adherents. She ruled over them,
organized amateur theatricals for them, picnicked with them and charmed
them with her house and her frocks and the epicurean and artistic
flavour of her life. They forgave her everything that they did not
understand&mdash;her &aelig;sthetic principles, her enthusiasm for
Wagner&mdash;because she gave them gaiety and a little <i>joie de
vivre</i> and a sociable feeling in the deadliness of their colonial
existence. For this they were fervently grateful to her. And thus it
had come about that her house became the actual centre of social life
at Labuwangi, whereas the residency, on the other hand, withdrew with
dignified reserve into the shadow of its banyan-trees. L&eacute;onie
van Oudijck <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>was not jealous on this account. She loved her
repose and was only too glad to leave everything to Eva Eldersma. And
so L&eacute;onie troubled about nothing&mdash;neither entertaining nor
musical societies nor dramatic societies nor charities&mdash;and
delegated to Eva all the social duties which as a rule a
resident&rsquo;s wife feels bound to take upon herself. L&eacute;onie
had her monthly receptions, at which she spoke to everybody and smiled
upon everybody, and gave her annual ball on New Year&rsquo;s Day. With
this the social life of the residency began and ended. Apart from this
she lived there in her egoism, in the comfort with which she had
selfishly surrounded herself, in her rosy dreams of cherubs and in such
love as she was able to evoke. Sometimes, periodically, she felt a need
for Batavia and went to spend a month or two there. And so she, as the
wife of the resident, led her own life; and Eva did everything and Eva
set the tone. It sometimes gave rise to a little jealousy, as for
instance between her and the wife of the inspector of finances, who
considered that the first place after Mrs. van Oudijck belonged to her
and not to the secretary&rsquo;s wife. This would occasion a good deal
of bickering over the Indian official etiquette; and stories and
tittle-tattle would go the rounds, <span class="corr" id="xd26e1061"
title="Source: enchanced">enhanced</span>, aggravated, until they
reached the remotest sugar-factory in the district. But Eva took no
notice of all this gossip and preferred to devote herself to providing
a little social life in Labuwangi. And, to keep things going properly,
she and her little circle ruled the roost. She had been elected
president of the Thalia Dramatic Society and she accepted, but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>on condition that the rules should be abolished.
She was willing to be queen, but without a constitution. Everybody said
that this would never do: there had always been rules. But Eva replied
that, if there were to be rules, she must refuse to be president. And
they gave way: the constitution of the Thalia was abolished; Eva held
absolute sway, chose the plays and distributed the parts. And it was
the golden age of the society: rehearsed by her, the members acted so
well that people came from Surabaya to attend the performances at the
Concordia. The pieces played were of a quality such as had never been
seen at the Concordia before.</p>
<p>And the result of this again was that people either loved her or did
not like her at all. But she went her way and provided a little
European civilization, so that they might not grow too
&ldquo;stuffy&rdquo; at Labuwangi. And people descended to all sorts of
trickery to get invited to her little dinners, which were famous and
notorious. For she stipulated that her men should come in dress-clothes
and not in their Singapore jackets, without shirts. She introduced
swallow-tails and white ties; and she was inexorable. The women were
low-necked, as usual, for the sake of coolness, and thought it
delightful. But her poor men struggled against it, puffed and blew at
first and felt congested in their tall collars; the doctor declared
that it was unhealthy; and the veterans protested that it was madness
and opposed to all the good old Indian customs. But when they had
puffed and blown a few times in their dress-coats and tall collars,
they all found Mrs. Eldersma&rsquo;s dinners charming, precisely
because they were so European in style. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">Eva was at home to her friends once a
fortnight: &ldquo;You see, resident, it&rsquo;s not a reception,&rdquo;
she always said, in self-defence, to Van Oudijck. &ldquo;I know that no
one&rsquo;s allowed to &lsquo;receive&rsquo; in the interior, except
the resident and his wife. It&rsquo;s really not a reception, resident.
I shouldn&rsquo;t dare to call it that. I&rsquo;m just at home to
everybody once a fortnight; and I&rsquo;m glad if our friends care to
come&#8202;&hellip;. It&rsquo;s all right, isn&rsquo;t it, resident, as
long as it&rsquo;s not a &lsquo;reception&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Oudijck would laugh merrily, with his jovial laugh shaking his
military moustache, and ask if little Mrs. Eldersma was pulling his
leg. She could do anything, if she would only continue to provide a
little gaiety, a little acting, a little music, a little pleasant
intercourse. That was her duty, once and for all: to look after the
social element at Labuwangi.</p>
<p>There was nothing Indian about her at-home days. For instance, at
the resident&rsquo;s, the receptions were regulated according to the
old inland practice: all the ladies sat side by side, on chairs along
the walls; Mrs. van Oudijck walked past them and talked to each for a
moment in turn, standing, while they remained sitting; the resident
chatted to the men in another gallery. The male and female elements
kept apart; gin-and-bitters, port and iced water were handed round.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span></p>
<p>At Eva&rsquo;s, people strolled about, walked through the galleries,
sat down wherever they pleased; everybody talked to everybody. There
was not the same ceremony as at the resident&rsquo;s, but there was all
the <i>chic</i> of a French drawing-room, with an artistic touch to it.
And it had become a habit for the ladies to dress more for Eva&rsquo;s
days than for the resident&rsquo;s receptions: at Eva&rsquo;s they wore
hats, a symbol of extreme elegance in India. Fortunately, L&eacute;onie
did not care; it left her totally indifferent.</p>
<p>L&eacute;onie was now sitting in the middle gallery, on a couch, and
remained sitting with the raden-aju, the wife of the regent. She liked
that: everybody came up to her, whereas at her own receptions she had
to do so much walking, past the row of ladies along the wall. Now she
took her ease, remained sitting, smiling on those who came to pay her
their respects. But, apart from this, there was a restless movement of
guests. Eva was here, there and everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s pretty here?&rdquo; Mrs. van der Does
asked L&eacute;onie, with a glance at the middle gallery.</p>
<p>And her eyes wandered in surprise over the dull arabesques, painted
in distemper on the pale-grey walls, like frescoes; over the teak
wainscoting, carved by skilful Chinese cabinetmakers after a drawing in
the <i>Studio</i>: over the bronze Japanese vases, on their teak
pedestals, in which branches of bamboo and bouquets of gigantic flowers
cast their shadows right up to the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd &hellip; but very pretty! Unusual!&rdquo; murmured
L&eacute;onie, to whom Eva&rsquo;s taste was always a conundrum.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>Withdrawn into herself as into a temple of egoism, she did not mind
what others did or felt, or how they arranged their houses. But she
could not have lived here. She liked her own lithographs&mdash;Veronese
and Shakespeare and Tasso: she thought them distinguished&mdash;liked
them better than the handsome carton photographs after Italian masters
which Eva had standing here and there on easels. Above all, she loved
her chocolate-box and the scent-advertisement with the little
angels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like that dress?&rdquo; Mrs. van der Does asked
next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; said L&eacute;onie, smiling pleasantly.
&ldquo;Eva&rsquo;s very clever: she painted those blue irises herself,
on Chinese silk&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She never said anything but kind, smiling things. She never spoke
evil; it left her indifferent. And she now turned to the raden-aju and
thanked her in kindly, drawling sentences for some fruit which the
latter had sent her. The regent came to speak to her and she asked
after his two little sons. She talked in Dutch and the regent and the
raden-aju both answered in Malay. The Regent of Labuwangi, Raden
Adipati Surio Sunario, was still young, just turned thirty: a refined
Javanese face like the conceited face of a puppet; a little moustache,
with the points carefully twisted; and, above all, a staring gaze that
struck the beholder, a gaze that stared as though in a continual
trance; a gaze that seemed to pierce the visible reality and to see
right through it; a gaze that issued from eyes like coals, sometimes
dull and weary, sometimes flashing like sparks of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>ecstasy
and fanaticism. Among the population, which was almost slavishly
attached to its regent and his family, he enjoyed a reputation for
sanctity and mystery, though no one ever knew the truth of the matter.
Here, in Eva&rsquo;s gallery, he merely produced the impression of a
puppet-like figure, of a distinguished Indian prince, save that his
trance-like eyes occasioned surprise. The sarong, drawn smoothly around
his hips, hung low in front in a bundle of flat, regular pleats, which
fluttered open; he wore a white starched shirt with diamond studs and a
little blue tie; over this was a blue cloth uniform-jacket, with gold
uniform buttons, with the royal &ldquo;W&rdquo; and the crown; his bare
feet were encased in black, patent-leather pumps turning up at the
pointed toes; the kerchief carefully wound about his head in narrow
folds imparted a feminine air to his refined features, but the black
eyes, now and then weary, constantly sparkled as in a trance, an
ecstasy. The golden kris was stuck in his blue-and-gold waist-band,
right behind, in the small of his back; a large jewel glittered on his
tiny, slender hand; and a cigarette-case of braided gold wire peeped
from the pocket of his jacket. He did not say much&mdash;sometimes he
looked as though he were asleep; then his strange eyes would flash up
again&mdash;and his replies to what L&eacute;onie said consisted almost
exclusively of a curt, clipped</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Saja</i>, yes&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He uttered the two syllables with a hard, sibilant accent of
politeness, laying equal stress upon each. He accompanied his little
word of civility with a brief, automatic nod of the head. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>The
raden-aju too, seated beside L&eacute;onie, answered in the same
way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Saja</i>&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she always followed it up with a little embarrassed laugh. She
was very young still, possibly just eighteen. She was a Solo princess;
and Van Oudijck could not tolerate her, because she introduced Solo
manners and Solo expressions into Labuwangi, in her conceited
arrogance, as though nothing could be so distinguished and so purely
aristocratic as what was done and said at the court of Solo. She
employed court phrases which the Labuwangi population did not
understand; she had forced the regent to engage a Solo coachman, with
the Solo state livery, including the wig and the false beard and
moustache, at which the people stared wide-eyed. Her yellow complexion
was made to appear yet paler by a light layer of rice-powder applied
moist; her eyebrows were slightly arched in a fine black streak;
jewelled hairpins were stuck in her glossy chignon and a kenanga-flower
in her girdle. Over an embroidered garment which, according to the
custom of the Solo court, was long and trailing in front, she wore a
kabaai of red brocade, relieved with gold braid and fastened with three
large gems. Two stones of fabulous value, moreover, in heavy silver
settings, dragged her ears down. She wore light-coloured open-work
stockings and gold embroidered slippers. Her little thin fingers were
stiff with rings, as though set in brilliants; and she held a white
marabou fan in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Saja &hellip; saja</i>,&rdquo; she answered, civilly, with
her embarrassed little laugh. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href=
"#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span></p>
<p>L&eacute;onie was silent for a moment, tired of carrying on the
conversation by herself. When she had spoken to the regent and the
raden-aju about their sons she could not find much more to say. Van
Oudijck, after Eva had shown him round the galleries&mdash;for there
was always something new to admire&mdash;joined his wife; the regent
rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, regent,&rdquo; asked the resident, in Dutch, &ldquo;how
is the raden-aju pang&eacute;ran?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was enquiring after Sunario&rsquo;s mother, the old
regent&rsquo;s widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well &hellip; thank you,&rdquo; murmured the regent, in
Malay. &ldquo;But mamma didn&rsquo;t come with us &hellip; so old
&hellip; easily tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to speak to you, regent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The regent followed Van Oudijck into the front verandah, which was
empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to have to tell you that I have just had another
bad report of your brother, the Regent of Ngadjiwa&#8202;&hellip;. I am
informed that he has lately been gambling again and has lost large sums
of money. Do you know anything about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The regent shut himself up, as it were, in his puppet-like stiffness
and kept silence. Only his eyes stared, as though gazing through Van
Oudijck at distant objects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about it, regent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tida</i>, no&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I request you, as head of the family, to look into it and to
keep a watch upon your brother. He gambles, he drinks; he does your
name no credit, regent. If the old pang&eacute;ran could have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>guessed that his second son would go to the dogs
like this, it would have pained him greatly. He held his name high. He
was one of the wisest and noblest regents that the government ever had
in Java; and you know how greatly the government valued the
pang&eacute;ran. Even in the Company&rsquo;s days, Holland owed much to
your house, which was always loyal to her. But the times seem to be
altering&#8202;&hellip;. It is very regrettable, regent, that an old
Javanese family with such lofty traditions as yours should be unable to
remain faithful to those traditions&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raden Adipati Surio Sunario turned pale with a greenish pallor. His
hypnotic eyes pierced the resident through; but he saw that the latter
too was boiling with anger. And he veiled the strange glitter of his
gaze with a drowsy weariness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought, resident, that you had always felt an affection
for my house,&rdquo; he murmured, almost plaintively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you thought right, regent. I loved the pang&eacute;ran. I
have always admired your house and have always tried to uphold it. I
want to uphold it still, together with yourself, regent, hoping that
you see not only, as your reputation suggests, the things of the next
world, but also the realities about you. But it is your brother,
regent, whom I do <i>not</i> love and cannot possibly esteem. I have
been told&mdash;and I can trust the words of those who told
me&mdash;that the Regent of Ngadjiwa has not only been gambling
&hellip; but also that he has failed this month to pay the heads at
Ngadjiwa their salaries&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at each other fixedly; and Van <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>Oudijck&rsquo;s firm and steady glance met the
regent&rsquo;s gaze, the gaze of a man in a trance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The persons who act as your informants may be
mistaken&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am assuming that they would not bring me such reports
without the most incontestable certainty&#8202;&hellip;. Regent, this
is a very delicate matter. I repeat, you are the head of your family.
Enquire of your younger brother to what extent he has misapplied the
money of the government and make it all good as soon as possible. I am
purposely leaving the matter to you. I will not speak to your brother
about it, in order to spare a member of your family as long as I can.
It is for you to admonish your brother, to call his attention to what
in my eyes is a crime, but one which you, by your prestige as the head
of the family, are still able to undo. Forbid him to gamble and order
him to master his passion. Otherwise I foresee very grievous things and
I shall have to propose your brother&rsquo;s dismissal. You yourself
know how I should dislike to do that. For the Regent of Ngadjiwa is the
second son of the old pang&eacute;ran, whom I held in high esteem, even
as I should always wish to spare your mother, the raden-aju
pang&eacute;ran, any sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; murmured Sunario.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reflect seriously upon what I am saying to you, regent. If
you cannot make your brother listen to reason, if the salaries of the
heads are not paid at the earliest possible date, then &hellip; then I
shall have to act. And, if <i>my</i> warning is of no avail, then it
means your brother&rsquo;s ruin. You yourself know, the dismissal of a
regent is such a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>very exceptional thing that it would bring
disgrace upon your family. Help me to save the house of the Adiningrats
from such a fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; murmured the regent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your hand, regent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Oudijck pressed the thin fingers of the Javanese:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I trust you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In life, in death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us go indoors. And tell me as soon as possible what
you have discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The regent bowed. A greenish pallor betrayed the silent, secret rage
which was working inside him like the fire of a volcano. His eyes,
behind Van Oudijck&rsquo;s back, stabbed with a mysterious hatred at
the Hollander, the low-born Hollander, the base commoner, the infidel
Christian, who had no business to feel anything, with that unclean soul
of his, concerning <i>him</i>, his house, his father, his mother, or
their supremely sacred aristocracy and nobility &hellip; even though
they had always bowed beneath the yoke of those who were stronger than
they&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78"

<p class="first">&ldquo;I have counted on your staying to
dinner,&rdquo; said Eva.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Van Helderen, the controller, and
his wife.</p>
<p>The reception&mdash;not a reception, as Eve always said in
self-defence&mdash;was nearly over: the Van Oudijcks had been the first
to go; the regent followed. The Eldersmas were left with their little
band of intimates: Dr. Rantzow and Doorn de Bruijn, the senior
engineer, with their wives, and the Van Helderens. They sat down in the
front verandah with a certain sense of relief and rocked comfortably to
and fro. Whiskies-and-soda and glasses of lemonade, with great lumps of
ice in them, were handed round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always chock full, reception at Eva&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Mrs.
van Helderen. &ldquo;Fuller than other day at
resident&rsquo;s&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ida van Helderen was the type of the white-skinned half-caste. She
always tried to behave in a very European fashion, to talk Dutch
nicely; she even pretended to speak bad Malay and not to care for
native dishes. She was short and plump all over; she was very white, a
dead white, with big, black, astonished eyes. She was full of little
mysterious fads and hatreds and affections; all her actions were the
result of mysterious little impulses. Sometimes she hated Eva,
sometimes she doted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79"
name="pb79">79</a>]</span>on her. She was absolutely unreliable; her
every action, her every movement, her every word might be a surprise.
She was always in love, tragically. She took all her little affairs
very tragically, on a very large and serious scale, with not the least
sense of proportion, and then unbosomed herself to Eva, who laughed and
comforted her.</p>
<p>Her husband, the controller, had never been in Holland: he had been
educated entirely in Batavia, at the William III. College and the
Indian Department. And he was very strange to see, this creole,
apparently quite European, tall, fair and pale, with his fair
moustache, his blue eyes, expressing animation and interest, and his
manners, which displayed a finer courtesy than could be found in the
smartest circles of Europe, but with not a vestige of India in thought,
speech or dress. He would speak of Paris and Vienna as though he had
spent years in both capitals, whereas he had never been out of Java; he
was mad on music, although he found it difficult to appreciate Wagner,
at least as Eva played him; and his great illusion was that he must
really go to Europe on leave next year, to see the Paris
Exhibition.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1220src" href="#xd26e1220" name=
"xd26e1220src">1</a> There was a wonderful distinction, an innate style
about young Van Helderen, as though he were not the offspring of
European parents who had always lived in India, as though he were a
foreigner from an unknown country, of a nationality which you could not
place at once. His accent barely betrayed a certain softness, resulting
from the climate; he spoke Dutch so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80"
href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>correctly that it would have
sounded almost stiff amid the slovenly slang of the mother-country; and
he spoke French, English and German with greater facility than most
Dutchmen. Perhaps he owed to a French mother that exotic and courtly
politeness, so innate, pleasant and natural. In his wife, who was also
of French extraction, springing from a creole family in R&eacute;union,
this exoticism had become a mysterious medley which had never developed
beyond a sort of childishness and a jumble of petty emotions and petty
passions, while she tried, with those great, sombre eyes of hers, to
read tragedy into her life, though she did no more than just dip into
it as into an ill-written magazine-story.</p>
<p>She now imagined herself to be in love with the senior engineer, the
oldest of the little band, a man already turning grey, with a black
beard; and, in her tragic fashion, she pictured scenes with Mrs. Doorn
de Bruijn, a stout, placid, melancholy woman. Dr. Rantzow and his wife
were Germans: he fat, fair-haired, vulgar, pot-bellied; she, with a
serene German face, pleasant and matronly, talking Dutch vivaciously
with a German accent.</p>
<p>This was the little clique over which Eva Eldersma reigned. In
addition to Frans van Helderen the controller, it consisted of quite
ordinary Indian and European elements, people without artistic sense,
as Eva said; but she had no other choice at Labuwangi, and therefore
she amused herself with Ida&rsquo;s little tragedies and made the best
of the others.</p>
<p>Onno, her husband, tired as usual with his work, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>did not
join much in the conversation, sat and listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long was Mrs. van Oudijck at Batavia?&rdquo; asked
Ida.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two months,&rdquo; said the doctor&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;A
very long visit, this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doorn de Bruijn, placid, melancholy
and quietly venomous, &ldquo;that this time one member of council, one
head of a department and three young business-men kept Mrs. van Oudijck
amused at Batavia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I can assure you people,&rdquo; said the doctor,
&ldquo;that, if Mrs. van Oudijck did not go to Batavia regularly, she
would miss a beneficial cure, even though she takes it on her own and
not &hellip; by my prescription.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us speak no evil!&rdquo; Eva interrupted, almost
entreatingly. &ldquo;Mrs. van Oudijck is beautiful&mdash;with a
tranquil Junoesque beauty and the eyes of a Venus&mdash;and I can
forgive anything to beautiful people about me. And you, doctor,&rdquo;
threatening him with her finger, &ldquo;mustn&rsquo;t betray
professional secrets. You doctors, in India, are often far too
outspoken about your patients&rsquo; secrets. When I&rsquo;m unwell,
it&rsquo;s never anything but a headache. Will you make a careful note
of that, doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The resident seems preoccupied,&rdquo; said Doorn de
Bruijn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could he know &hellip; about his wife?&rdquo; asked Ida,
sombrely, her great eyes filled with black velvet tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The resident is often like that,&rdquo; said Frans van
Helderen. &ldquo;He has his moods. Sometimes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>he&rsquo;s pleasant, cheerful, jovial, as he was
lately, on circuit. Then again he has his gloomy days, working, working
and working and grumbling that nobody does any work except
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor, unappreciated Onno!&rdquo; sighed Eva.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he&rsquo;s overworking himself,&rdquo; said Van
Helderen. &ldquo;Labuwangi is a tremendously busy district. And the
resident takes things too much to heart, both in his own house and
outside, in his relations with his son and his relations with the
regent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should sack the regent,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, doctor,&rdquo; said Van Helderen, &ldquo;you know enough
about conditions in Java to know that things can&rsquo;t be done just
like that. The regent and his family are closely identified with
Labuwangi and too highly considered by the
population&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know the Dutch policy. The English in British India
deal with their Indian princes in a more arbitrary and high-handed
fashion. The Dutch treat them much too gently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question might arise which of the two policies is the
better in the long run,&rdquo; said Van Helderen, drily, hating to hear
a foreigner disparage anything in a Dutch colony. &ldquo;Fortunately,
we know nothing here of the continual poverty and famine that prevail
in British India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw the resident speaking very seriously to the
regent,&rdquo; said Doorn de Bruijn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The resident is too susceptible,&rdquo; said Van Helderen.
&ldquo;He allows himself to be greatly dejected by the gradual decline
of this old Javanese family, which is doomed to go under, though
he&rsquo;d like to hold it up&#8202;&hellip;. The resident, cool and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>practical though he may be, is a bit of a romantic
in this, though he might refuse to admit it. But he remembers the
Adiningrats&rsquo; glorious past, he remembers that last fine figure,
the noble old pang&eacute;ran, and he compares him with his sons, the
one a fanatic, the other a gambler&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think our regent&mdash;not the Ngadjiwa one: he&rsquo;s a
coolie&mdash;delightful!&rdquo; said Eva. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a living
figure out of a puppet-show. Except his eyes: they frighten me. What
terrible eyes! Sometimes they&rsquo;re asleep and sometimes
they&rsquo;re like a maniac&rsquo;s. But he is so refined, so
distinguished! And the raden-aju too is an exquisite little doll:
&lsquo;<i>Saja &hellip; saja!</i>&rsquo; She says nothing, but she
looks very decorative. I&rsquo;m always glad when they adorn my at-home
day and I miss them when they&rsquo;re not there. And the old raden-aju
pang&eacute;ran, grey-haired, dignified, a
queen&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gambler of the first water,&rdquo; said Eldersma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They gamble away all they possess,&rdquo; said Van Helderen,
&ldquo;she and the regent of Ngadjiwa. They&rsquo;re no longer rich.
The old pang&eacute;ran used to have splendid insignia of rank for
state occasions, magnificent lances, a jewelled betel-box,
spittoons&mdash;useful objects, those!&mdash;of priceless value. The
old raden-aju has gambled them all away. I doubt if she has anything
left but her pension: two hundred and forty guilders a month, I
believe. And how our regent manages to keep all his cousins, male and
female, in the <i>Kabupaten</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1283src"
href="#xd26e1283" name="xd26e1283src">2</a> according to the Javanese
custom, is beyond me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What custom is that?&rdquo; asked the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every regent collects his whole family around <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>him like
parasites, clothes them, feeds them, provides them with pocket-money
&hellip; and the natives think it dignified and smart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sad &hellip; that ruined greatness!&rdquo; said Ida,
gloomily.</p>
<p>A boy came to announce dinner and they went to the back verandah and
sat down to table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what have you in prospect for us, mevrouwtje?&rdquo;
asked the senior engineer. &ldquo;What are the plans? Labuwangi has
been very quiet lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really terrible,&rdquo; said Eva. &ldquo;If I
hadn&rsquo;t all of you, it would be terrible. If I weren&rsquo;t
always planning something and having ideas, it would be terrible, this
living at Labuwangi. My husband doesn&rsquo;t feel it; he works, as all
you men do: what else is there to do in India but work, regardless of
the heat? But for us women! What a life, if we didn&rsquo;t find our
happiness purely in ourselves, in our home, in our friends &hellip;
when we have the good fortune to possess those friends! Nothing from
the outside. Not a picture, not a statue to look at; no music to listen
to. Don&rsquo;t be cross, Van Helderen. You play the &rsquo;cello
charmingly, but nobody in India can keep up to date. The Italian Opera
plays <i lang="it">Il Trovatore</i>. The amateur companies&mdash;and
they&rsquo;re really first-rate at Batavia&mdash;play &hellip; <i lang=
"it">Il Trovatore</i>. And you, Van Helderen &hellip; don&rsquo;t
object. I saw you in an ecstasy when the Italian company from
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1307" title=
"Source: Surubaya">Surabaya</span> were here lately, at the club,
playing &hellip; <i lang="it">Il Trovatore</i>. You were
enchanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were some beautiful voices among them.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But twenty years ago, they tell me, even then people were
enchanted with &hellip; <i lang="it">Il Trovatore</i>. Oh, it&rsquo;s
terrible! Sometimes, suddenly, it crushes me. Sometimes, all of a
sudden, I feel that I have not grown used to India and that I never
shall; and I began to long for Europe, for life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Eva,&rdquo; Eldersma began, in alarm, dreading lest she
should really go home one day, leaving him alone in what would then be
his utterly joyless working-life at Labuwangi: &ldquo;sometimes you do
appreciate India: your house, the pleasant, spacious
life&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Materially&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you appreciate your own work&mdash;I mean the
many things which you are able to do here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Getting up parties? Arranging theatricals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you who are the real <i>rezidente</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1333src" href="#xd26e1333" name=
"xd26e1333src">3</a>,&rdquo; said Ida, gushingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness, we&rsquo;re coming back to Mrs. van
Oudijck,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doom de Bruijn, teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to professional secrecy,&rdquo; said Dr. Rantzow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; sighed Eva, &ldquo;we want something new. Dances,
parties, picnics, trips into the mountains &hellip; we&rsquo;ve
exhausted all that. I know nothing more. The Indian depression&rsquo;s
coming over me. I&rsquo;m in one of my dejected moods. Those brown
faces of my &lsquo;boys&rsquo; around me suddenly strike me as uncanny.
India frightens me at times. Do none of you feel the same? A vague
dread, a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>mystery in the air, something
menacing&#8202;&hellip;. I don&rsquo;t know what it is. The evenings
are sometimes so full of mystery and there is something mysterious in
the character of the native, who is so remote from us, who differs from
us so&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Artistic feelings,&rdquo; said Van Helderen, chaffingly.
&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t feel like that. India is my
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>type</i>!&rdquo; said Eva, chaffing him in return.
&ldquo;What makes you what you are, so curiously European? I
can&rsquo;t call it Dutch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother was a Frenchwoman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, after all, you&rsquo;re a creole: born here, brought up
here&#8202;&hellip;. And you have nothing of a creole about you. I
think it&rsquo;s wonderful to have met you: I like you as a
change&#8202;&hellip;. Help me, can&rsquo;t you? Suggest something new.
Not a dance, not a trip into the mountains. I want something new. Else
I shall get a craving for my father&rsquo;s paintings, for my
mother&rsquo;s singing, for our beautiful, artistic house at the Hague.
If I don&rsquo;t have something new, I shall die. I&rsquo;m not like
your wife, Van Helderen, always in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eva!&rdquo; Ida entreated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tragically in love, with her beautiful, sombre eyes. Always,
first with her husband and then with somebody else. I am never in love.
Not even any longer with my husband. He is &hellip; with me. But I have
not an erotic temperament. There&rsquo;s a great deal of love-making in
India, isn&rsquo;t there, doctor?&hellip; Well, we&rsquo;ve ruled out
dances, excursions into the mountains and love-making. What then, in
Heaven&rsquo;s name, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know of something,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doorn de <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>Bruijn;
and a sudden anxiety came over her placid melancholy.</p>
<p>She gave a side-glance at Mrs. Rantzow; the German woman grasped her
meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the others, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Table-turning,&rdquo; whispered the two ladies.</p>
<p>There was a general laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; sighed Eva, disappointed. &ldquo;A trick, a
joke, an evening&rsquo;s amusement. No, I want something that will fill
my life for at least a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Table-turning,&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Rantzow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doorn de Bruijn. &ldquo;The
other day, for a joke, we tried making a gipsy-table turn. We all
promised not to cheat. The table &hellip; moved, spelt out words,
tapping them out by the alphabet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But was there no cheating?&rdquo; asked the doctor, Eldersma
and Van Helderen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to trust us,&rdquo; declared the two
ladies, in self-defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Eva. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve finished
dinner. Let&rsquo;s have some table-turning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must all promise not to cheat,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rantzow.
&ldquo;I can see that my husband will be &hellip; antipathetic. But Ida
&hellip; a great medium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must we have the lights out?&rdquo; asked Eva.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doorn de Bruijn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An ordinary gipsy-table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A three-legged wooden table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eight of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we must begin by choosing: for instance, yourself, Eva,
Ida, Van Helderen, and Mrs. Rantzow. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>The doctor&rsquo;s
antipathetic; so is Eldersma. De Bruijn and I will relieve
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire away, then!&rdquo; said Eva. &ldquo;A new diversion for
Labuwangi society. And no cheating&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must give one another our word of honour, as friends, not
to cheat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; they all said.</p>
<p>The doctor sniggered. Eldersma shrugged his shoulders. A boy brought
a gipsy-table. They sat round the little wooden table and placed their
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1412" title=
"Source: figners">fingers</span> on it lightly, looking at one another
expectantly and suspiciously. Mrs. Rantzow was solemn, Eva amused, Ida
sombre, Van Helderen smilingly indifferent. Suddenly a strained
expression came over Ida&rsquo;s beautiful half-caste face.</p>
<p>The table quivered&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>They exchanged frightened glances; the doctor sniggered.</p>
<p>Then slowly, the table tilted one of its three legs and carefully
put it down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did anybody move?&rdquo; asked Eva.</p>
<p>They all shook their heads. Ida had turned pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel a trembling in my fingers,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>The table once more tilted its leg, described an angry, grating
semicircle over the marble floor and put its leg down with a violent
stamp.</p>
<p>They looked at one another in surprise. Ida sat as though bereft of
life, staring, with fingers outspread, ecstatically.</p>
<p>And the table tilted its leg for the third time.</p>
<p>It was certainly very curious. Eva doubted for a moment whether Mrs.
Rantzow was lifting the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href=
"#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>table, but, when she questioned her
with a glance, the German doctor&rsquo;s wife shook her head and Eva
saw that she was playing fair. They once more promised absolute
honesty. And, when they were now certain of one another, in full
confidence, it was most curious how the table continued to describe
angry, grating semicircles, tilting one leg and tapping on the marble
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a spirit present, revealing itself?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Rantzow, with a glance at the leg of the table.</p>
<p>The table tapped once:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, when the spirit was asked to spell its name, to tap out the
letters of its name by the letters of the alphabet, all that came
was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Z X R S A.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manifestation was incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Suddenly, however, the table began spelling hurriedly, as though it
had something at its heels. The taps were counted and spelt:</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&eacute; &hellip; onie Ou &hellip;
dijck&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Mrs. van Oudijck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A coarse word followed.</p>
<p>The ladies started, excepting Ida, who sat as though in a
trance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The table has spoken&#8202;&hellip;. What did it say?&hellip;
What is Mrs. van Oudijck?&rdquo; cried the voices, all speaking at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s incredible!&rdquo; murmured Eva. &ldquo;Are we all
playing fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all protested their honesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us really be honest, else there&rsquo;s no fun in
it&#8202;&hellip;. I wish I could be certain.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span></p>
<p>They all wished that: Mrs. Rantzow, Ida, Van Helderen, Eva. The
others looked on eagerly, believing; but the doctor did not believe and
sat sniggering.</p>
<p>Again the table grated angrily and tapped: and the leg began to
spell, &ldquo;A&#8202;&hellip;,&rdquo; and repeated the coarse
word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Rantzow.</p>
<p>The table began to tap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write it down, Onno!&rdquo; said Eva to her husband.</p>
<p>Eldersma fetched a pencil and paper and wrote the message down.</p>
<p>Three names followed: one of a member of council, one of a
departmental head, and one of a young business-man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When people aren&rsquo;t backbiting in India, the tables
begin to backbite!&rdquo; said Eva.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spirits,&rdquo; murmured Ida.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are generally mocking spirits,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rantzow,
didactically.</p>
<p>But the table went on tapping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write it down, Onno!&rdquo; said Eva.</p>
<p>Eldersma wrote it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A-d-d-i-e!&rdquo; the leg tapped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; the voices all cried together, in vehement denial.
&ldquo;This time the table&rsquo;s mistaken!&hellip; At least, young De
Luce has never yet been mentioned in connection with Mrs. van
Oudijck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;T-h-e-o!&rdquo; said the table, correcting itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her step-son!&hellip; It&rsquo;s terrible!&hellip;
That&rsquo;s different!&hellip; Everybody knows that!&rdquo; cried the
voices in assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we know that!&rdquo; said Mrs. Rantzow, with a glance at
the leg of the table. &ldquo;Come, tell us <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>something that we don&rsquo;t know. Come, table!
Come, spirit! Please!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She addressed the table-leg in coaxing, wheedling accents. Everybody
laughed. The table grated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be serious!&rdquo; Mrs. Doorn de Bruijn said, in warning.</p>
<p>The table bounced down on Ida&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my!&rdquo; cried the pretty half-caste, waking out of her
trance. &ldquo;Right against my stomach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They laughed and laughed. The table turned round fiercely and they
rose from their chairs, with their hands on the table, and accompanied
its angry, waltzing movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next &hellip; year &hellip;&rdquo; the table rapped out.</p>
<p>Eldersma wrote it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frightful &hellip; war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Europe &hellip; and &hellip; China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like a fairy-tale!&rdquo; grinned the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;La-bu-wangi,&rdquo; tapped the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is &hellip; a &hellip; beastly &hellip;
hole&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say something serious, table, do!&rdquo; Mrs. Rantzow
implored, pleasantly, in her best German-matron manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan &hellip; ger,&rdquo; the table tapped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Threat &hellip; ens,&rdquo; the table continued,
&ldquo;La-bu-wangi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danger threatens Labuwangi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said the table, with one tap, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What danger?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href=

<p>&ldquo;Rebellion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rebellion? Who&rsquo;s going to rebel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In &hellip; two months &hellip; Sunario.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They became thoughtful.</p>
<p>But the table, suddenly, unexpectedly, fell over again into
Ida&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my! Oh dear!&rdquo; cried the little woman.</p>
<p>The table refused to go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired,&rdquo; it tapped out.</p>
<p>They continued to hold their hands on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave off,&rdquo; said the table.</p>
<p>The doctor, sniggering, laid his short, broad hand on it, as though
to compel it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to blazes!&rdquo; cried the table, grating and turning.
&ldquo;Bounder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And worse words followed, aimed at the doctor, as though by a
street-boy: obscene words, senseless and incoherent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s suggesting those words?&rdquo; asked Eva,
indignantly.</p>
<p>Obviously no one was suggesting them, neither the three ladies nor
Van Helderen, who was always very punctilious and who was manifestly
indignant at the mocking spirit&rsquo;s coarseness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really is a spirit,&rdquo; said Ida, looking very
pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to leave off,&rdquo; said Eva, nervously,
lifting up her fingers. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand this nonsense.
It&rsquo;s quite amusing, but the table&rsquo;s not accustomed to
polite society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a new resource for Labuwangi!&rdquo; said
Eldersma. &ldquo;No more picnics, no dances &hellip; but
table-turning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must practise!&rdquo; said Mrs. Doorn de Bruijn.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span></p>
<p>Eva shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s inexplicable,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
bound to believe that none of us was cheating. It&rsquo;s not the sort
of thing Van Helderen would do, to suggest such words as
those.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam!&rdquo; said Van Helderen, defending himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must do it again,&rdquo; said Ida. &ldquo;Look,
there&rsquo;s a hadji leaving the grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hadji?&rdquo; asked Eva.</p>
<p>She looked towards the garden, expecting to see a Mecca pilgrim.
There was nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, it&rsquo;s not!&rdquo; said Ida. &ldquo;I thought it
was a hadji. It&rsquo;s nothing, only the moonlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was late. They said good-night, laughing gaily, wondering, but
finding no explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope this hasn&rsquo;t made you ladies nervous?&rdquo;
said the doctor.</p>
<p>No, considering all things, they were not nervous. They were more
amused, even though they did not understand.</p>
<p>It was two o&rsquo;clock when they went home. The moonlight was
streaming down on the town, which lay deathly still, slumbering in the
velvet shadows of the gardens. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94"

<p class="first dropcap">Next day, when Eldersma had gone to the office
and Eva was moving about the house, in sarong and kabaai, on her
domestic duties, she saw Frans van Helderen coming through the
garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I?&rdquo; he called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she called back. &ldquo;Come in. But
I&rsquo;m on my way to the godown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she held up her bunch of keys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m due at the resident&rsquo;s in half an hour, but
I&rsquo;m too early &hellip; so I just looked in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m busy, you know!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come
along to the godown with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He followed her; he was wearing a black alpaca jacket, because he
had to go to the resident presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Ida?&rdquo; asked Eva. &ldquo;Did she sleep well
after her <i>s&eacute;ance</i> of last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only fairly well,&rdquo; said Frans van Helderen. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think she ought to do any more. She kept waking with a
start, falling on my neck and begging me to forgive her, I don&rsquo;t
know what for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t upset me at all,&rdquo; said Eva,
&ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t understand it in the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened the godown, called the cook and gave the woman her
orders. The cook <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>was <i>latta</i>;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1658src" href="#xd26e1658" name="xd26e1658src">1</a> and Eva
loved teasing the old thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;La &hellip; la-illa-lala!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>And the cook gave a start and echoed the cry and recovered herself
the next moment, begging for forgiveness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw down, cook, throw down!&rdquo; cried Eva, in Malay.</p>
<p>And the cook, acting on the suggestion, flung down a tray of litchis
and mangosteens and, at once recovering, stooped and picked up the
scattered fruits from the floor, imploring to be forgiven and shaking
her head and clicking her tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, we&rsquo;d better go!&rdquo; said Eva to Frans.
&ldquo;Else she&rsquo;ll be breaking my eggs presently. &ldquo;Out of
this, cook, outside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of this, outside!&rdquo; echoed the <i>latta</i> cook.
&ldquo;Oh, mem sahib, beg pardon, mem sahib, oh, enough, enough, mem
sahib!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and sit down for a little,&rdquo; said Eva to Van
Helderen.</p>
<p>He went with her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so cheerful,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve been feeling sad, lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I too. I told you so yesterday. It&rsquo;s something in the
Labuwangi air. There&rsquo;s no telling what this table-turning has in
store for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat down in the back verandah. He sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she asked. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I care for you
so. I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent for an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again?&rdquo; she then said, reproachfully.</p>
<p>He did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you, mine is not a passionate nature. I am cold.
I love my husband and my child. Let&rsquo;s be friends, Van
Helderen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fighting against it; but it&rsquo;s no
use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fond of Ida; I wouldn&rsquo;t make her unhappy for
the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I was ever fond of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Van Helderen!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was, it was only for her pretty face. But white though
Ida may be, she&rsquo;s a half-caste &hellip; with her whimsies and her
childish little tragedies. I didn&rsquo;t see it so much at first, but
I see it now, of course. I&rsquo;d met women from Europe before I met
you. But you were a revelation to me, a revelation of all the charm and
artistic grace that a woman can possess&#8202;&hellip;. And the exotic
side in you appeals to my own exotic side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I value your friendship highly. Let things remain as they
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s just as though I were mad, sometimes I
dream &hellip; that we&rsquo;re travelling in Europe together, that
we&rsquo;re in Italy or Paris. Sometimes I see us sitting together over
a fire, in a room of our own, you talking of art, I of the modern,
social developments of our time. But, after that, I see us together
&hellip; more intimately&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Van Helderen!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no longer any use your warning me. I love you,
Eva, Eva&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97"
href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s another country where
there&rsquo;s so much love going about as in India! I suppose
it&rsquo;s the heat&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t crush me with your sarcasm. No other woman ever
made such an appeal to my whole soul and body as you do,
Eva&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, Van Helderen, but I can&rsquo;t stand
these commonplaces. Let us be sensible. I have a charming husband, you
have a dear little wife. We&rsquo;re all good, pleasant friends
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so cold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to spoil the happiness of our
friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friendship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friendship is what I said. There is nothing I value so
highly, except my domestic happiness. I couldn&rsquo;t live without
friends. I am happy in my husband and my child; next to these I need
friends, above all things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that they can admire you, so that you can rule over
them!&rdquo; said he, angrily.</p>
<p>She looked him in the face:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she said, coolly. &ldquo;Perhaps I have a
need of admiration and of ruling over others. We all have our
weaknesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have mine,&rdquo; he said, bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, in a kinder tone, &ldquo;let us remain
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am terribly unhappy,&rdquo; he said, in a dull voice.
&ldquo;I feel as if I had missed everything in life. I have never been
out of Java and I feel there&rsquo;s something lacking in me because I
have never seen ice and snow. Snow: I think of it as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>a sort
of mysterious unknown purity, which I long for, but which I never seem
to meet. When shall I see Europe? When shall I cease to rave about
<i lang="it">Il Trovatore</i> and manage to visit Bayreuth? When shall
I come within range of you, Eva? I&rsquo;m feeling for everything with
my antenn&aelig;, like a wingless insect&#8202;&hellip;. What <i>is</i>
my life?&hellip; With Ida, with three children, whom I foresee growing
up like their mother!&hellip; I shall remain controller for years and
then&mdash;possibly&mdash;be promoted to assistant-resident &hellip;
and so remain. And then at last I shall receive my dismissal&mdash;or
ask for it&mdash;and go to Sukabumi to live, to vegetate on a small
pension. I feel everything in me longing for
idleness&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like your work, for all that; you&rsquo;re a first-rate
official. Eldersma always says that in India a man who doesn&rsquo;t
work and who doesn&rsquo;t love his work is lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your nature is not made for love and mine is not made for
work: not for that and nothing else. I can work for an aim that I see
before me, a beautiful aim; but I can&rsquo;t work &hellip; just for
work&rsquo;s sake and to fill the emptiness in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your aim is India&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine phrase,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It may be so for a man
like the resident, who has succeeded in his career and who never has to
sit studying the <i>Colonial List</i> and calculating on the illness of
this man or the death of that &hellip; so that he may get promoted.
It&rsquo;s all right for a man like Van Oudijck, who, in his genuine,
honest idealism, thinks that his aim is India, not because of Holland,
but because of India herself, because of the native <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>whom he,
the official, protects against the tyranny of the landlords and
planters. I am more cynical by nature&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t be so lukewarm about India. It&rsquo;s not
merely a fine phrase: I feel like that myself. India is our whole
greatness, the greatness of us Hollanders. Listen to foreigners
speaking of India: they are all enchanted with her glory, with our
methods of colonization&#8202;&hellip;. Don&rsquo;t have anything to do
with the wretched Dutch spirit of our people at home, who know nothing
about India, who always have a sneering word for India, who are so
petty and stiff and <i>bourgeois</i> and
narrow-minded&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that you were so enthusiastic about
India. Only yesterday you were full of wretched anxieties, and I was
standing up for my country&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it gives me a sort of shudder, the mystery in the
evenings, when something seems to threaten I don&rsquo;t know what!
I&rsquo;m afraid of the future; there&rsquo;s danger ahead of
us!&hellip; I feel that I, personally, am still very remote from India,
though I don&rsquo;t want to be; that I miss the art amid which I was
educated; that I miss here, in our everyday life, the plastic beauty
which both my parents always pointed out to me&#8202;&hellip;. But I am
not unjust. And I think that India, as our colony, is great; I think
that we, in our colony, are great&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Formerly, perhaps it was so. Nowadays, everything is going
wrong; nowadays, we are no longer great. You have an artistic nature;
you are always looking for artistic perfection in India, though you
seldom find it. And then your mind <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100"
href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>is confronted with that
greatness, that glory. That&rsquo;s the poetry of it. The prose of it
is a gigantic but exhausted colony, still governed from Holland with
one idea: the pursuit of gain. The reality is not an India under a
great ruler, but an India under a petty, mean-souled blood-sucker; the
country sucked dry; and the real population&mdash;not the Hollander,
who spends his Indian money at The Hague, but the population, the
native population, attached to the native soil&mdash;oppressed by the
disdain of its overlord, who once improved it with his own blood, and
now threatening to revolt against this oppression and
disdain&#8202;&hellip;. You, as an artist, feel the danger approaching,
vaguely, like a cloud in the sky, in the Indian night; I see the danger
as something very real, something rising&mdash;before Holland&mdash;if
not from America and Japan, then out of the soil of India
herself&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you when you talk like this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
should end by falling in with your views.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could achieve <i>that</i> by talking!&rdquo; he laughed,
bitterly, getting up. &ldquo;My half hour is over: the resident is
expecting me and he doesn&rsquo;t like waiting a minute. Goodbye
&hellip; and forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;am I a flirt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You are what you are. And I
can&rsquo;t help it: I love you&#8202;&hellip;. I am always stretching
out my poor antenn&aelig;. That is my fate&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall help you to forget me,&rdquo; said she, with
affectionate conviction. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=
"#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>He gave a little laugh, bowed and went away. She saw him cross the
road to the grounds of the resident&rsquo;s house, where a messenger
met him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really life, when all is said, is one long self-deception, a
wandering amid illusions,&rdquo; she thought, sadly, drearily. &ldquo;A
great aim, an universal aim &hellip; or even a modest aim for
one&rsquo;s self, for one&rsquo;s own body and soul: O God, how little
it all is! And how we roam about, knowing nothing! And each of us seeks
his own little aim, his illusion. The only happy people are merely
exceptions, like L&eacute;onie van Oudijck, who lives no more than a
beautiful flower does, or a beautiful animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her child came toddling up to her, a pretty, fair-haired, plump
little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sonny,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;how will it be with you?
What will be your portion? Oh, perhaps nothing new! Perhaps a
repetition of what has so often been before. Life is a story which is
always being repeated&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, when we feel like this, how
oppressive India can be!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kissed her boy; her tears trickled over his fair curls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Van Oudijck has his residency; I my little circle of &hellip;
admirers and subjects; Frans his love &hellip; for me: we all have our
playthings, just like my little Onno playing with his little horse. How
small we are, how small!&hellip; All our lives we make believe,
pretending, imagining all sorts of things, thinking that we are giving
a path or a direction to our poor, aimless little lives. Oh, why am I
like this, sonny? Sonny, sonny, how will it be with you?&rdquo;

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">The Patjaram sugar-factory was fourteen miles
from Labuwangi and twelve from Ngadjiwa and belonged to the
half-Eurasian, half-Solo family of De Luce, a family who had once been
millionaires, but were no longer so very well off, owing to the recent
sugar-crisis, though they still supported a numerous household. This
family, which always kept together&mdash;the old mother and
grandmother, a Solo princess; the eldest son, the manager; three
married daughters and their husbands, clerks in the factory, all living
in its shadow; three younger sons employed in the factory; the many
grandchildren, playing round and about the factory; the
great-grandchildren springing up round and about the factory&mdash;this
family maintained the old Indian traditions which, at one time
universal, are now becoming rarer, thanks to the more frequent
intercourse with Europeans. The mother and grandmother was the daughter
of a Solo prince and had married a young and enterprising bohemian
adventurer, Ferdinand de Luce, a member of a French titled family of
Mauritius, who, after wandering about for many years in search of his
place in the sun, had sailed to India as a ship&rsquo;s steward, and,
after all sorts of vicissitudes, had found himself stranded in Solo,
where he achieved fame by means of a dish prepared with tomatoes and
another consisting of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href=
"#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>stuffed chilies. Thanks to these
recipes, Ferdinand de Luce won the favour of the Solo princess, whose
hand he afterwards obtained, and even that of the old Susuhunan. After
his marriage he became a landowner, and, according to the national
usage, a vassal of the Susuhunan of Solo, whom he supplied daily with
rice and fruits for the household of the palace. Then he had launched
out into sugar, divining the millions which a lucky fate held in store
for him. He had died before the crisis, laden with wealth and
honours.</p>
<p>The old grandmother, in whom there was not a trace left of the young
princess whom Ferdinand de Luce had wedded to promote his fortunes, was
never approached by the servants or the Javanese staff save with a
cringing reverence; and everybody gave her the title of Raden-aju
pang&eacute;ran. She did not speak a word of Dutch. Wrinkled like a
shrivelled fruit, with her clouded eyes and her withered, betel-stained
mouth, she was peacefully living her last years, always dressed in a
dark silk kabaai, the neck and the light sleeves of which were fastened
with precious stones. Before her sun-bitten gaze there hovered the
vision of her former palace grandeur, which she had abandoned for love
of that French nobleman-cook who had pandered to her father&rsquo;s
taste with his dainty recipes; in her ears buzzed the constant murmur
of the centrifugal separators, like the thrashing of screw propellers,
throughout the milling-season, which lasted for months on end; around
her were her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren: the sons
and daughters addressed as raden and raden-adjeng by the servants; all
of them still <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>surrounded by the pale halo of their Solo
descent. The eldest daughter was married to a full-blooded, fair-haired
Dutchman; the son who followed her to an Armenian girl; the two others
were married to Eurasians, both brown; and their brown
children&mdash;who were also married and also had
children&mdash;mingled with the fair-haired family of the eldest
daughter; and the pride of the whole family was the youngest son and
brother, Adrien, or Addie, who made love to Doddie van Oudijck and who
was constantly at Labuwangi, the busy milling-season
notwithstanding.</p>
<p>In this family, traditions were still maintained, now quite
obsolete, such as people remembered in the Indian families of long ago.
Here you still saw, in the grounds, in the back verandah, the
numberless babus,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1831src" href="#xd26e1831"
name="xd26e1831src">1</a> one grinding rice into a fine face-powder,
another preparing incense, another pounding diverse condiments, all
with dreamy eyes, all with slender, nimbly-moving fingers. Here the
habit still prevailed of an endless array of dishes at lunch, with a
long row of servants, one after the other, solemnly handing round one
more vegetable, one more sauce, one more dish of chicken, while,
squatting behind the ladies, the babus pounded each a different
condiment in an earthenware mortar, according to the several tastes and
requirements of the sated palates. Here it was still the custom, when
the family attended the races at Ngadjiwa, for each of the ladies to
appear followed by a babu, moving slowly, lithely, solemnly; one babu
carrying a betel-pot, another a <i>bonbonni&egrave;re</i> filled with
peppermints, or a pair <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href=
"#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>of race-glasses, or a fan, or a
scent-bottle; the whole resembling a ceremonial procession bearing the
insignia of state. Here, too, you still found the old-fashioned
hospitality: the row of spare-rooms open to any one who cared to knock;
here all could stay as long as they pleased; no one was asked the
object of his journey or the date of his departure. A great simplicity
of mind, an all-embracing, spontaneous, innate cordiality prevailed,
together with an unbounded weariness and tedium, a life of no ideas and
but few words, the ready, gentle smile making good the lack of both; a
material life, full and sated: a life of cool drinks and native pastry
and fruit-salad handed round all day, three babus being specially
appointed to make fruit-salad and pastry. Any number of animals were
scattered over the estate: there was a cage full of monkeys; a few
lories; dogs, cats, some tame squirrels and an exquisite little dwarf
deer, which ran about loose. The house, built on to the factory,
quaking all through the milling-season with the noise of
machinery&mdash;like the throbs of screw propellers&mdash;was spacious
and furnished with the old, old-fashioned furniture: the low wooden
bedsteads with four carved bed-posts hung with curtains; the
heavy-legged tables; the rocking-chairs with peculiarly round backs:
all things which are now no longer obtainable; nothing that betrayed
the least touch of modernity, except&mdash;and this only during the
milling-season&mdash;the electric light in the front verandah! The
occupants were always in indoor dress: the men in white or
blue-and-white striped pyjamas; the ladies in sarong and kabaai, toying
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>with a monkey or a lory or a doe, in simplicity
of mind, with ever the same pleasant jest, drawling and drowsy, and the
same gentle little laugh. The passions, which were certainly there,
slumbered in that gentle smile. Then, when the milling-season was over;
when all the bustle was over; when the files of sugar-carts, drawn by
the superb oxen, with glossy brown hides, had brought an
ever-increasing store of canes over the fibre-covered road, which was
cut to pieces by the broad cart-ruts; when the seed had been bought for
next year and the machines were stopped: then came the sudden
relaxation after the incessant labour, the long, long holiday, the many
months&rsquo; rest, the craving for festivity and enjoyment; the big
dinner given by the lady of the house, followed by a ball and <i lang=
"fr">tableaux-vivants</i>; the whole house full of visitors, who stayed
on and on, known and unknown; the old, wrinkled grandmamma, the
landowner, the raden-aju, Mrs. de Luce, whatever you liked to call her,
always amiable, with her dull eyes and her betel-stained mouth, amiable
to one and all, with always an <i>anak-mas</i>, a &ldquo;golden
child,&rdquo; a poor little adopted princess at her heels, carrying a
gold betel-box behind the great princess from Solo: a slender little
woman of eight years old, her front hair cut into a fringe, her
forehead whitened with moist rice-powder, her already rounded little
breasts confined in the little pink silk kabaai, with the miniature
gold sarong round the slender hips; a doll, a toy for the raden-aju,
for Mrs. de Luce, for the Dowager de Luce. And for the compounds there
were the popular rejoicings, a time-honoured lavishness, in which all
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>Patjaram shared, according to the age-old
tradition which was always observed, despite any crisis or unrest.</p>
<p>The milling-season and the rejoicings were now over. There was
comparative peace indoors; and a languorous Indian calm had set in. But
Mrs. van Oudijck, Theo and Doddie had come over for the festivities and
were staying on a few days longer at Patjaram. A great circle of people
sat round the marble table covered with glasses of syrup, lemonade and
whisky-and-soda; they did not speak much, but rocked luxuriously,
exchanging an occasional word. Mrs. de Luce and Mrs. van Oudijck spoke
Malay, but were not talkative. A gentle, good-humoured boredom drifted
down on all these rocking people. It was strange to see the different
types: the pretty, milk-white L&eacute;onie beside the yellow, wrinkled
raden-aju-dowager; Theo, pale and fair as a Dutchman, with his full,
sensual lips, which he inherited from his half-caste mother; Doddie,
already looking like a ripe rose, with the sparkling irises and black
pupils of her black eyes; the manager&rsquo;s son, Achille de Luce,
brown, tall and stout, whose thoughts ran only on his machinery and his
seed; the second son, Roger, brown, short and thin, the book-keeper,
whose thoughts ran only on the year&rsquo;s profits, with his little
Armenian wife; the eldest daughter, old already, brown, stupidly ugly,
with her full-blooded Dutch husband, who looked like a peasant; the
other sons and daughters, in every shade of brown, not easily to be
distinguished one from the other; around them the children, the
grandchildren, the little, golden-skinned adopted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>children, the babus, the lories and the dwarf
deer; and over all these people and children and animals, as though
shaken down upon them, lay a good-hearted solidarity; and over all
these people there also lay a common pride in their Solo ancestors,
crowning all their heads with a pale halo of Javanese aristocracy; and
the Armenian daughter-in-law and the bucolic Dutch son-in-law were not
least proud of this descent.</p>
<p>The liveliest of all these elements, which were melting into one
another, as it were, through long communal life under the patriarchal
roofs, was the youngest son, Adrien de Luce, Addie, in whom the blood
of the Solo princess and that of the French adventurer had blended
harmoniously. The admixture, it is true, had given him no brains, but
it had given him the physical beauty of a young Eurasian, with
something of the Moor about it, something southern and seductive,
something Spanish, as though in this last child the two alien racial
elements had for the first time mingled harmoniously, for the first
time been wedded in absolute mutual sympathy; as though in him, this
last child after so many children, adventurer and princess had for the
first time met in harmony. Addie seemed to possess not a jot of
intellect or imagination; he was unable to unite two ideas into one
composite thought; he merely felt, with the vague good-nature which had
descended upon the whole family. For the rest, he was like a beautiful
animal, degenerating in soul and brain, but degenerating into nothing,
to a great nullity, to one great emptiness, while his body was like a
renewal of his race, full of strength and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>beauty, while his
marrow and his blood and his flesh and his muscles were all one harmony
of physical seductiveness, so purely, stupidly, beautifully sensual
that its harmony had for a woman an immediate appeal. The lad had but
to appear, like a beautiful, southern god, for all the women to look at
him and take him into the depths of their imagination, to recall him to
their minds again and again; the lad had but to go to a race-ball at
Ngadjiwa for all the girls to fall in love with him. He plucked love
where he found it, in plenty, in the Patjaram compounds. And everything
feminine was in love with him, from his mother to his little nieces.
Doddie van Oudijck was infatuated with him. From a child of seven she
had been in love, a hundred times and more, with every one who passed
before the glance of her flashing pupils, but never yet as with Addie.
Her love shone so strongly from her whole being that it was like a
flame, that everybody saw it and smiled. The milling-feast had been to
her one long delight &hellip; when she danced with him; one long
martyrdom &hellip; when he danced with others. He had not asked her to
marry him, but she thought of asking <i>him</i> and was prepared to die
if he refused. She knew that the resident, her father, would object: he
did not like those De Luces, that Solo-French crew, as he called them;
but, if Addie was willing, her father would consent, rather than see
her die. To this child of love that lovable lad was the world, the
universe, life itself. He made love to her, he kissed her on the lips,
but this was no more than he did to others, unthinkingly; he kissed
other girls as well. And, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href=
"#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>if he could, he went further, like
a devastating young god, an unthinking god. But he still stood more or
less in awe of the resident&rsquo;s daughter. He possessed neither
pluck nor effrontery; his passions were not markedly selective; he
looked on a woman as a woman and was so much sated with conquest that
obstacles did not stimulate him. His garden was full of flowers which
all lifted themselves up to him; he stretched out his hand, almost
without looking; he merely plucked.</p>
<p>As they sat rocking about the table they saw him come through the
garden; and the eyes of all these women turned to him as to a young
tempter, arriving in the sunshine, which touched him as with a halo.
The raden-aju dowager smiled and gazed at him, enamoured of her son,
her favourite; squatting on the ground behind her, the little golden
adopted child stared with wide-open eyes; the sisters looked out, the
little nieces looked out, and Doddie turned pale and L&eacute;onie van
Oudijck&rsquo;s milky whiteness became tinged with a rosy shade which
mingled with the glamour of her smile. She glanced at Theo
mechanically; their eyes met. And these souls of sheer love, love of
the eyes, of the lips, love of the glowing flesh, understood each
other; and Theo&rsquo;s jealousy of L&eacute;onie blazed so fiercely
that the rosy shade died away and she became pale and fearful, with a
sudden, unreasoning fear which shuddered through her usual
indifference, while the tempter, in his halo of sunshine, came nearer
and nearer&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">Mrs. van Oudijck had promised to stay at
Patjaram a few days longer; and she disliked the prospect, really not
feeling quite at home in these old-fashioned Indian surroundings. But
when Addie appeared she thought better of it. In the deepest secrecy of
her heart this woman worshipped her sensuality, as in the temple of her
egoism: here the milk-white creole offered up all the most intimate
dreams of her rosy imagination and unquenchable longing; and in this
cult she had achieved as it were an art, a knowledge, a science, that
of deciding, for herself, at a glance, what it was that attracted her
in the man who approached her, in the man who passed her by. In one it
was his bearing, his voice; in another it was the set of his neck on
his shoulders; in a third it was the way his hand rested on his knee;
but, whatever it was, she saw it directly, at a glance; she knew it
immediately, in an instant; she had judged the passer-by in an
indivisible moment; and she at once knew those whom she
rejected&mdash;they were the majority&mdash;and those whom she
approved&mdash;they were many. And the few whom she rejected in that
indivisible moment of her supreme judgement, with that single glance,
in that single instant, need cherish no hope: she, the priestess, did
not admit them to the temple. To the others, the temple was open, but
only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>behind the curtain of her conventionality.
However shameless, she was always correct, her love was always secret;
to the world, she was nothing but the charming, smiling wife of the
resident, a little indolent in her ways, but winning everybody with her
smile. When people did not see her, they spoke ill of her; when they
saw her, she conquered them at once. Among all of those with whom she
shared the secret of her love there reigned a certain freemasonry, a
mystery of worship; scarcely, when two of them met, would they whisper
a word or two, at a similar recollection. And L&eacute;onie could sit
smiling, milk-white, tranquil, in the great circle, around the marble
table, with at least two or three men who knew her secret. It did not
disturb her tranquillity nor mar her smile. She smiled to the pitch of
boredom. Scarcely would her glance glide from one to the other, while
she judged them once again, with her infallible knack of judgement.
Scarcely would the memories of past hours rise hazily within her,
scarcely would she think of the assignation for the following day. The
secret lay wholly in the mystery of the meeting and indeed was never
uttered before the profane world. If a foot in the circle sought to
touch her foot, she drew hers away. She never flirted; she was even
sometimes a little tedious, stiff, correct, smiling. In the freemasonry
between herself and the initiated she disclosed the mystery; but,
before the world, in the circles about the marble tables, she
vouchsafed not a glance, not a pressure of the hand or knee.</p>
<p>She had been bored during these days at Patjaram, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>for
which she had accepted the invitation to the milling-feast because she
had refused it in past years; but now that she saw Addie approaching
she was bored no longer. Of course she had known him for years; and she
had seen him grow from a child into a boy, into a man; and she had
kissed him even as a boy. She had long ago judged him, the tempter. But
now, as he came forward with his halo of sunshine, she judged him once
more: his comely, slender animalism and the glow of his tempter&rsquo;s
eyes in the dusky brown of his young Moorish face; the pouting curves
of his lips, formed for kissing, with the young down of his moustache;
the tigerish strength and litheness of limbs which Don Juan might have
envied: it all dazzled her, made her blink her eyes. As he greeted his
mother&rsquo;s visitors and sat down, a volley of wordy gaiety ran
round that circle of languid conversation and drowsy thoughts, as
though he were casting a handful of his sunshine, of the gold-dust of
his temptation over them all, over all those women, mother and sisters
and nieces and Doddie and L&eacute;onie van Oudijck. L&eacute;onie
looked at him, as they all looked at him, and her glance fell upon his
hands. She could have kissed those hands of his; she suddenly became
smitten with the shape of his fingers, with the brown, tigerish
strength of the hands themselves: she suddenly became smitten with all
the young wild-animal vigour which breathed like a fragrance of manhood
from the whole of his boyish frame. She felt her blood throbbing,
almost uncontrollably, despite her great art of remaining cool and
correct in the circles around the marble <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>tables. But she was
no longer bored. She had found an object to fill the next few days.
Only &hellip; her blood throbbed so violently that Theo had noticed her
blush and the quivering of her eyelids. Enamoured of her as he was, his
eyes had penetrated her soul. And, when they rose to go to lunch in the
back verandah, where the <i>babus</i> had been squatting, grinding
everybody&rsquo;s different admixture of spices with pestles, in little
stone mortars, he whispered two words between his teeth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started; she felt that he was threatening her. This had never
happened before: all who had shared in the mystery had always respected
her. She started so violently, she was so indignant at this wrenching
away of the temple-curtain, in a verandah full of people, that her
tranquil indifference seethed with anger and she was roused to
rebellion in her ever-serene self-mastery. But she looked at him and
she saw him broad and tall and fair, a younger edition of her husband,
his Indian blood showing only in his sensuous mouth; and she did not
want to lose him: she wanted to preserve his type beside the type of
the Moorish tempter. She wanted them both; she wanted to taste the
different charm of their respective types, that white-skinned Dutch
type, so very slightly Indian, and Addie&rsquo;s wild-animal type. Her
soul quivered, her blood thrilled, while the long array of dishes was
solemnly handed round. She was in a revolt such as she had never
experienced before. The awakening from her placid indifference was like
a rebirth, like an unknown <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href=
"#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>emotion. She was surprised to
remember that she, at thirty, was feeling for the first time. A
feverish depravity blossomed up within her, as though bursting into
heady crimson flowers. She looked at Doddie, sitting beside Addie: the
poor child, glowing with love, was hardly able to eat&#8202;&hellip;.
Oh, the tempter, who had only to appear!&hellip; And L&eacute;onie, in
this fever of depravity, rejoiced at being the rival of a step-daughter
so many years younger than herself. She would look after her; she would
even warn Van Oudijck. Would it ever come to a match? What did she
care: what harm could marriage do to her, L&eacute;onie? Oh, the
tempter! Never had she dreamt of him thus, the supreme lover, in her
rosy hours of siesta! This was no charm of little cherubs; this was the
stark radiance of tigerish enchantment: the golden glitter of his eyes,
the sinewy litheness of his stealthy paw&#8202;&hellip;. And she smiled
at Theo, with just one glance of self-surrender, a very exceptional
thing at the luncheon-table. As a rule she gave nothing of herself in
public. Now she surrendered herself, for a moment, pleased by his
jealousy. She was madly fond of him too. She thought it delightful,
that he should look pale and angry with jealousy. And round about her
the afternoon was one blaze of sunlight and the hot spices stung her
dry palate. Faint beads of perspiration stood on her forehead and
trickled down her bosom under the lace of her kabaai. And she would
fain have clasped them both, Theo and Addie, in one embrace, in one
blending of different lusts, pressing them both to her amorous
woman&rsquo;s body&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116"

<h2 class="main">Chapter Thirteen</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">The night was like a veil of softest velvet
dropping slowly from the heavens. The moon, in its first quarter,
displayed a very narrow, horizontal sickle, like a Turkish crescent,
between whose points the unlit portion of the disk was faintly washed
in against the sky. A long avenue of tjemara-trees stretched in front
of the house, their trunks straight, their leafage like drawn plush or
ravelled velvet, showing like blots of cotton-wool against the clouds,
which, drifting low, announced the approaching rainy monsoon fully a
month beforehand. Wood-pigeons cooed at intervals and a gecko was
calling, first with two rattling, preliminary notes, as though tuning
up, then with his call of &ldquo;<i>Tokk&egrave;!</i>
<i>Tokk&egrave;!</i>&rdquo; four or five times repeated: first loudly,
then submissively and more faintly.</p>
<p>A night watchman, in his hut in front of the house, on the
high-road, where the sleeping market-place now showed its empty stalls,
struck eleven blows on his hollow block of wood; and as yet one more
belated cart drove past, he cried, in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night was like softest velvet dropping slowly from the heavens,
like a whirling mystery, like an oppressive menace of the future. But,
in that mystery, under the frayed black blots, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>ravelled plush of the tjemaras, there was an
inexorable incitement to love, in the windless night, like a whisper
that this hour should not be wasted&#8202;&hellip;. True, the gecko was
gibing like a mocking imp, with a sort of dry humour; and the watchman,
with his &ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo; startled the hearer; but the
wood-pigeons cooed softly and the whole night was like a world of
softest velvet, like a great alcove curtained by the plush of the
tjemaras, while the distant, sultry rain-clouds, hanging all that month
on the horizon, ringed the skies with an oppressive spell. Mystery and
enchantment hovered through the velvety night, drifting down in the
twilit alcove; and at their touch all thought was dissolved; the very
soul dissolved, leaving only a warm, sensuous
vision&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The gecko fell silent, the watchman dropped asleep; the velvety
night reigned like an enchantress crowned with the sickle of the moon.
They came walking slowly, two youthful figures, their arms about each
other&rsquo;s waists, lips seeking lips under the tyranny of the
enchantment. They were as shadows under the drawn velvet of the
tjemaras; and softly, in their white garments, they dawned on the
beholder like an eternal pair of lovers who are forever and everywhere
repeating themselves. And here above all were lovers inevitable, in
this enchanted night, were one with the night, conjured up by the
all-powerful spell; here they were inevitable, unfolding like a twin
flower of predestined love, in the velvet mystery of the compelling
heavens.</p>
<p>And the tempter seemed to be the son of that night, the son of that
inexorable queen of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href=
"#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>night, bearing with him the
yielding girl. In her ears the night seemed to sing with his voice; and
her small soul melted in tender compliance, under these magic powers.
She walked on against his side, feeling the warmth of his body sinking
into her yearning maidenhood; and she lifted her brimming gaze to him,
with the languid light of her sparkling pupils glittering like diamonds
in her eyes. He, drunk with the power of the night, the enchantress,
who was as his mother, thought first of leading her still farther, no
longer conscious of reality, no longer feeling any awe of her or of any
one whatever; thought of leading her still farther, past the slumbering
watchman, across the high road, into the compound, which lay hidden
yonder between the stately plumes of the coco-palms that would form a
canopy to their love; of leading her to a hiding-place, a house which
he knew, a bamboo hut the door of which would be opened to him &hellip;
when suddenly she stopped &hellip; and started &hellip; and gripped his
arm and pressed herself still more tightly against him and implored him
to go no farther. She was frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked, gently, in his soft voice, which
was as deep and velvety as the night. &ldquo;Why not to-night, to-night
at last?&hellip; There is no danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she shuddered and shook and entreated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addie, Addie, no &hellip; no&#8202;&hellip;. I daren&rsquo;t
go any farther&#8202;&hellip;. I&rsquo;m frightened that the watchman
will see us &hellip; and then &hellip; there&rsquo;s a hadji walking
over there &hellip; in a white turban&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked out at the road: on the farther side <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>the
kampong lay waiting, under the canopy of the coco-palms, with the
bamboo hut whose door would be opened to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hadji?&hellip; Where, Doddie? I don&rsquo;t see any
one&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He crossed the road; he looked back at us; he saw us: I saw
his eyes gleaming; and he went into the compound, behind those
trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling, I saw nothing, there&rsquo;s no one
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is! Yes, there is! Addie, I daren&rsquo;t go: oh,
do let us go back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His handsome Moorish face became overcast; he already saw the door
of the little hut opened by the old woman whom he knew, who worshipped
him as every woman worshipped him, from his mother to his little
nieces.</p>
<p>And he again tried to persuade her, but she refused, stood still,
and clung to the ground with her little feet. Then they turned back and
the clouds were sultrier, low on the horizon, and the velvety darkness
fell more thickly, like warm snow, and the ravelled tjemaras were
fuller and blacker than before. The house loomed up before them, sunk
in sleep, with not a light showing. And he entreated her, he implored
her not to leave him that night, saying that he would die, that night,
without her&#8202;&hellip;. Already she was yielding, promising, with
her arms around his neck &hellip; when again she started and again
cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addie! Addie!&hellip; There he is again!&hellip; That white
figure!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you seem to see hadjis everywhere!&rdquo; he said,
banteringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look for yourself then &hellip; over there!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>He looked, and now really saw a white figure approaching them in the
front-verandah. But it was a woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma!&rdquo; cried Doddie, in dismay.</p>
<p>It was indeed L&eacute;onie, slowly coming towards them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doddie,&rdquo; she said, gently, &ldquo;I have been hunting
for you everywhere. I was so frightened, I didn&rsquo;t know where you
were. Why do you go out walking so late? Addie,&rdquo; she continued
gently, in kind, motherly tones, as though addressing two children,
&ldquo;how <i>can</i> you behave like this and be out with Doddie so
late? You really mustn&rsquo;t do it again: I mean it! I know that
there&rsquo;s nothing in it; but suppose any one saw you! You must
promise me <i>never</i> to do it again! You&rsquo;ll promise,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She begged this prettily, in tones of engaging reproach, as though
to show that she quite understood him, quite realized that they were
yearning for each other in that velvet night of enchantment, forgiving
them at once in the words which she uttered. She looked like an angel,
with her round, white face in the loose, waving, fair hair, in the
white silk kimono which hung round her in supple folds. And she drew
Doddie to her and kissed the girl and wiped away her tears. And then,
gently, she pushed Doddie before her, to her room in the annexe, where
she slept safely amidst so many other rooms full of the daughters and
grandchildren of old Mrs. de Luce. And, while Doddie, softly crying,
went to the <i>solitude</i> of her room, L&eacute;onie continued to
speak words of gentle reproach to Addie, warning him, prettily
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>now, as a sister might do, while he, brown and
handsome, with his Moorish look, stood before her, bantering yet
embarrassed. They were in the dusk of the dark front verandah; and the
night outside exhaled its inexorable breath of luxuriance, love and
velvety mystery. And she reproached him and warned him and said that
Doddie was a child and that he mustn&rsquo;t take advantage of her. He
shrugged his shoulders, defended himself, in his bantering manner. His
words fell upon her like gold-dust, while his eyes glittered like a
tiger&rsquo;s. As she argued persuasively that he must really spare
Doddie in the future, she seized his hand, that hand of which she was
enamoured, his fingers, his palm, which she could have kissed that
morning in her confusion; and she pressed it and almost cried and
implored him to have mercy on Doddie&#8202;&hellip;. He suddenly
realized it, he looked at her suddenly with the lightning of his
wild-animal glance and he found her beautiful, was aware of her as a
woman, white as milk, and he knew her for a priestess full of secret
knowledge. And he too spoke of Doddie, coming closer to L&eacute;onie,
touching her, pressing her hands between his two hands, giving her to
understand that he understood. And, still pretending to weep and
entreat and implore, she led him on and opened the door of her room. He
saw a faint light and her maid, Oorip, who disappeared through the
outer door and lay down to sleep there, like a faithful dog, on a
little mat. Then she gave him a laugh of welcome; and he, the tempter,
was amazed at the glowing laugh of this white, fair-haired temptress,
who flung off her silken kimono and stood <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>before him, like a
nude statue, spreading out her arms&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Oorip, outside, listened for a moment. And she was about to lie down
to sleep, smiling, dreaming of the lovely sarongs which the mem sahib
would give her to-morrow, when she started as she saw walking through
the grounds and disappearing in the night a hadji in a white
turban&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">That day the Regent of Ngadjiwa,
Sunario&rsquo;s younger brother, was to pay a visit at Patjaram,
because Mrs. van Oudijck was leaving on the following day. They sat
waiting for him in the front verandah, rocking about the marble table,
when his carriage came rattling down the long avenue of tjemaras. They
all stood up. And now it appeared more plainly than ever how highly
respected the old raden-aju, the dowager, was, how closely related to
the Susuhunan himself, for the regent alighted and, without taking
another step, squatted on the lowest stair of the verandah and salaamed
respectfully, while behind his back a retainer, holding up the closed
gold-and-white umbrella like a furled sun, made himself still smaller
and shrank together in self-annihilation. And the old woman, the Solo
princess, who once more saw the palace gleaming before her, went to
meet him and welcomed him with all the courtesy of palace Javanese, the
language spoken among princely equals, till the regent rose and,
following her, approached the family circle. And the manner in which he
then, for the first time, bowed to the wife of his resident, however
polite, was almost condescending, compared with his obsequiousness of a
moment ago&#8202;&hellip;. He now sat down between Mrs. de Luce and
Mrs. van Oudijck; and a drawling conversation began. The Regent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>of Ngadjiwa was a different type from his
brother Sunario; taller, coarser, without the other&rsquo;s look of a
marionette in a puppet-show; though younger, he looked the older of the
two, with his eyes seared with passion: the passion for women, and
wine, the passion for opium, the passion, above all, for gambling. And
a silent thought seemed to flash up in that listless, drawling
conversation, with few words and no ideas, ever and again interrupted
by the courtly &ldquo;<i>Saja</i>, <i>saja</i>,&rdquo; behind which
they all concealed their secret longing&#8202;&hellip;. They spoke
Malay because Mrs. van Oudijck did not dare to speak Javanese, that
refined, difficult language, full of shades of etiquette, on which
hardly a single Hollander ventures when speaking to Javanese persons of
rank. They spoke little; they rocked gently; a vague, courteous smile
showed that all were taking part in the conversation, though only Mrs.
de Luce and the Regent exchanged an occasional word&#8202;&hellip;.
Until at last the De Luces&mdash;the old mother, her son Roger, her
brown daughters-in-law&mdash;were no longer able to restrain
themselves, even in Mrs. van Oudijck&rsquo;s presence, and laughed
shyly while drinks and cakes were being handed round; until,
notwithstanding their courtesy, they rapidly consulted one another,
over L&eacute;onie&rsquo;s head, in a few words of Javanese; until the
old mother, no longer mistress of herself, at last asked her whether
she would mind if they had a little game of cards. And they all looked
at her, the wife of the resident, the wife of the high official who,
they knew, hated the gambling which was ruining them, which was
destroying the grandeur of the Javanese families whom he wished to
uphold <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>in spite of themselves. But she was too
indifferent to think of preventing them with a single word of tactful
jest, for her husband&rsquo;s sake; she, the slave of her own passion,
allowed them to be the slave of theirs, in the luxury of their
enslavement. She merely smiled and readily permitted the players to
withdraw to the twilight of the spacious, oblong inner gallery, the
ladies counting their money into their handkerchiefs, alternating with
the men, until they were sitting close together, and, with their eyes
on the cards or spying into one another&rsquo;s eyes, gambled and
gambled endlessly, winning, losing, paying or receiving, just opening
and closing the handkerchiefs containing the money, with never a word
nor a sound but the faint rustle of the cards in the twilight of the
inner room. What game were they playing? L&eacute;onie did not know,
did not care, indifferent to their passion and glad that Addie had
remained beside her and that Theo was glaring at him jealously. Did he
know, did he suspect anything? Would Oorip always hold her tongue? She
enjoyed the emotion and she wanted them both; she wanted both white and
brown; and the fact that Doddie was sitting on the other side of Addie
and almost swooning as she rocked to and fro afforded her an acute and
wicked delight. What else was there in life but to yield to one&rsquo;s
luxurious cravings? She had no ambition and was indifferent to her
exalted station; she, the first woman in the residency, who delegated
all her duties to Eva Eldersma, who was quite unmoved when hundreds of
people, at the receptions at Labuwangi, Ngadjiwa and elsewhere, greeted
her with a ceremony not far short of royal honours, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>who,
in her rosy, perverse day-dreams, with a novel by Catulle Mend&egrave;s
in her hands, silently laughed at the exaggerated ideas that ruled
up-country, where the wife of a resident is treated as a queen. She had
no other ambition than to be loved by the men whom she selected, no
other emotional life than the worship of her body, like an Aphrodite
who chose to be her own priestess. What did she care if they played
cards in there, if the Regent of Ngadjiwa was ruining himself! On the
contrary, she thought it interesting to read that ruin on his seamed
face; and she would take care to be even more carefully groomed, to let
Oorip massage her face and limbs, to make Oorip prepare even more of
the white moist rice-powder, the wonderful cream, the magic salve of
which Oorip knew the secret and which kept her flesh firm and
unwrinkled and white as a mangosteen. She thought it exciting to see
the Regent of Ngadjiwa burning away like a candle, foolishly,
brutalized by women, wine, opium and cards; perhaps most of all by
cards; by that bewildered glaring at them; by high play, and the
calculation of chances which defied calculation, superstitiously
reckoning by sacred omens the day and the hour when he should play in
order to win, the number of the players, the amount of his
stake&#8202;&hellip;. Now and then she took a furtive glance at the
faces of the players in the inner gallery, darkened by twilight and the
lust of gain, and reflected on what Van Oudijck would say, how angry he
would be if she told him about it&#8202;&hellip;. What did it matter to
him if the regent&rsquo;s family ruined themselves? What did his policy
matter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>to her, what did the whole Dutch policy matter,
which aims at securing the position of the Javanese nobility, through
whom it governs the population? What did it matter to her that Van
Oudijck, thinking of the noble old pang&eacute;ran, was grieved by his
children&rsquo;s visible decline? None of it mattered to her; what
mattered was only herself and Addie and Theo. She must really tell her
step-son, her fair-haired lover, that afternoon, not to be so jealous.
It was becoming obvious; she was sure that Doddie noticed
it&#8202;&hellip;. Didn&rsquo;t she save the poor child yesterday? But
how long would that yearning last? Hadn&rsquo;t she better warn Van
Oudijck, like a kind, solicitous mother?&hellip; Her thoughts wandered
languidly; it was a sultry morning, in those last, scorching days of
the eastern monsoon, which cover the limbs with trickling moisture. A
shiver ran through her body; and, leaving Doddie with Addie, she
carried Theo off and reproached him for looking so savage with impotent
jealousy. She pretended to be a little angry and asked him what he
wanted.</p>
<p>They had gone to the side of the house, to the long side-verandah;
there were monkeys here in a cage, with skins strewn all around from
the bananas which the animals had eaten, fed to them by the
children.</p>
<p>The luncheon-gong had already sounded twice; the babus were
squatting in the back-verandah, pounding everybody&rsquo;s spices. But
the people around the card-table seemed to hear nothing. Only the
whispering voices became louder and shriller, so that L&eacute;onie and
Theo, as well as Addie and Doddie, pricked up their ears. A dispute
seemed suddenly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128"
name="pb128">128</a>]</span>to break out between Roger and the regent,
notwithstanding Mrs. de Luce&rsquo;s attempts to hush it. They spoke
Javanese, but they let all courtesy go to the winds. Like two coolies,
they abused each other for cheats, constantly interrupted by the
soothing efforts of old Mrs. de Luce, supported by her daughters and
daughters-in-law. But the chairs were roughly thrust back; a glass was
broken. Roger seemed to dash his cards down in anger. All the women in
the inner room took part in the soothing process, their voices raised,
or muffled, or whispering, with little outcries, little shrieks of
apology and indignation. The servants, innumerable, were listening in
every corner of the house. Then the dispute abated, but long,
explanatory arguments still continued between the regent and Roger; the
women tried to hush them down&mdash;&ldquo;Ssh!&hellip;
Ssh!&rdquo;&mdash;embarrassed because of the resident&rsquo;s wife,
looking out to see where she might be. And at last all was quiet and
they sat down in silence, hoping that not too much of the dispute had
reached her ears. Until at length, very late&mdash;it was almost three
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;old Mrs. de Luce, with the gambling-passion still
blazing in her dim eyes, summoning all her distinction and her princely
prestige, went to the verandah and, as though nothing had happened,
asked Mrs. van Oudijck if she would not come in to lunch. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">Yes, Theo knew. He had spoken to Oorip after
lunch; and although the maid had at first tried to deny everything,
afraid of losing the sarongs, she had been unable to continue lying and
had contented herself with feeble little protests of &ldquo;no &hellip;
no.&rdquo;&hellip; And, still early that same afternoon, raging with
jealousy, he sought out Addie. But Theo was calmed by the indifferent
composure of the good-looking youth, with his Moorish face, already so
fully sated with his conquests that he himself never felt any jealousy.
Theo was calmed by the complete absence of thought in this tempter, who
at once forgot everything after an hour of love; forgot so gracefully
that he looked up with eyes of ingenuous surprise when Theo, red and
boiling with fury, burst into his room and, standing before his
bed&mdash;where he was lying quite naked, as was his habit during his
siesta, with the magnificence of a bronze statue, sublime as an ancient
sculpture&mdash;declared that he would strike him across the face. And
Addie&rsquo;s surprise was so artless, his indifference so harmonious,
he seemed to have so utterly forgotten his hour of love of the night
before, he laughed so serenely at the idea of fighting about a woman
that Theo quieted down and came and sat on the edge of his bed. And
then Addie, who was a couple of years younger but possessed
incomparable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>experience, told him that he really
mustn&rsquo;t do it again&mdash;get so angry about a woman, a mistress
who gave herself to another. And Addie patted him on the shoulder with
almost fatherly compassion; and now, since they understood each other,
they went on confidentially pumping one another as they chatted.</p>
<p>They exchanged further confidences, about women, about girls. Theo
asked if Addie was going to marry Doddie. But Addie said that he
wasn&rsquo;t thinking of marrying and that the resident wouldn&rsquo;t
be willing either, because he didn&rsquo;t care for Addie&rsquo;s
family and thought them too Indian. Then, in a single word, he let slip
his pride in his Solo descent and his pride in the halo which shone
dimly behind the heads of all the De Luces. And Addie asked if Theo
knew that he had a young brother running wild in the compound. Theo
knew nothing about it. But Addie assured him that it was so: a young
son of papa&rsquo;s, mark you, from the time when the governor was
still controller at Ngadjiwa; a fellow of their own age, a regular
Eurasian: the mother was dead. Perhaps the old man himself didn&rsquo;t
know that he still had a son in the compound, but it was true;
everybody knew it: the regent knew, the native councillor knew, the
head of the district knew, and the meanest coolie knew. There was no
actual proof; but a thing like that, which was known the whole world
over, was as true as that the world itself existed&#8202;&hellip;. What
did the fellow do? Nothing, except curse and swear, declaring that he
was a son of the kandjeng tuan resid&egrave;n, who allowed him to rot
in the compound&#8202;&hellip;. What <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>did he live on? On
nothing, on what he got by shameless begging, on what people gave him
and then &hellip; by all sorts of practices: by going round the
districts, through all the villages, and asking if there were any
complaints and then drawing up little petitions; by encouraging people
to go to Mecca and let him book their passages with very cheap little
steamship-companies of which he was the unofficial agent: he would go
to the remotest village and display coloured posters representing a
steamer full of Mecca pilgrims and the Kaaba and the Sacred Tomb of
Mohammed. He would mess around like this, sometimes mixed up in rows,
once in a robbery, sometimes dressed in a sarong, sometimes in an old
striped calico suit; and he slept anywhere. And, when Theo showed
surprise and said that he had never heard of this half-brother of his
and expressed curiosity, Addie suggested that they should go and look
him up, if he was to be found in the compound. And Addie gaily and
quickly took his bath and put on a clean white suit; and they went
across the road and along the rice-fields into the compound.</p>
<p>It was already dusk under the heavy trees: the bananas lifted the
cool green paddles of their leaves; and under the stately canopy of the
coco-palms the little bamboo houses hid, romantically Oriental,
idyllic, with their palm-leaf roofs, their doors often already closed,
or, if open, framing a little black inward vista, with the vague
outline of a bench on which squatted a dark figure. The scabby,
hairless dogs barked; the children, naked, with bells dangling from
their stomachs, ran indoors and stared out <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>of
the houses; the women kept quiet, recognizing the tempter and vaguely
laughing, blinking their eyes as he passed in his glory. And Addie
pointed to the little house where his old babu lived, Tidjem, the woman
who helped him, who always opened her door to him when he wanted the
use of her hut, who worshipped him as his mother and his sisters and
his little nieces worshipped him. He showed Theo the house and thought
of his walk last night with Doddie under the tjemaras. Tidjem the babu
saw him and ran up to him delightedly. She squatted down beside him,
she pressed his leg against her withered breast, she rubbed her
forehead against his knee, she kissed his white shoe, she gazed at him
in rapture, her beautiful prince, her <i>raden</i>, whom she had rocked
as a little chubby boy in her already infatuated arms. He tapped her on
the shoulder and gave her a rix-dollar and asked her if she knew where
Si-Oudijck was, because his brother wished to see him.</p>
<p>Tidjem stood up and beckoned to him to follow: it was some way to
walk. And they stepped out of the compound into an open road with rails
along it, by which the bamboo baskets filled with sugar were removed to
the proas that lay moored at a landing-stage yonder, in the Brantas.
The sun was going down in a fan-shaped glory of orange sheaves; and the
distant rows of trees that outlined the paddy-fields were washed in
with dark, soft, velvety touches against their arrogant glow. These
fields were not yet planted, but their dark, earth-coloured expanse lay
as broken by the plough. From the factory came a few men and women,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>making their way home. Beside the river, by the
landing-stage, a small market of portable kitchens had been set up
under a sacred, five-fold banyan-tree, with its five trunks merging
into one another and its wide-spreading roots. Tidjem called the
ferry-man and he put them across, across the orange Brantas, amidst the
last yellow rays of the sun, outspread fanwise like a peacock&rsquo;s
tail. When they were on the other bank, the night fell over everything,
like the hasty fall of a gauze curtain; and the clouds, which all
through November had threatened the low horizons, hung oppressively on
the sultry air. And they entered another compound, lit here and there
by a paraffin-lamp, set down on the ground, with a long lamp-glass but
no globe. At last they came to a little house, built partly of bamboo,
partly of old packing-cases, and roofed partly with tiles, partly with
palm-leaves. Tidjem pointed to it and, once more squatting on the
ground and embracing and kissing Addie&rsquo;s knee, asked permission
to depart. Addie knocked at the door; a grumbling and rumbling within
was the only answer; but, when Addie called out, the door was kicked
open and the two young men stepped into the one room of which the hut
consisted: half bamboo, half deal boards from packing-cases; a couch
with a couple of dirty pillows in a corner, and a limp chintz curtain
dangling in front of it; a crazy table with a chair or two; on the
table, a paraffin-lamp without a globe; and a litter of oddments
stacked on a packing-case in a corner. Everything was permeated with an
acrid odour of opium.</p>
<p>And Si-Oudijck was sitting at the table with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>an
Arab, while a Javanese woman squatted on the couch, preparing a leaf of
betel for herself. A few sheets of paper lay on the table between the
Arab and the young half-caste. The last-named, evidently annoyed by the
unexpected visit, hurriedly crumpled the papers together. But he
recovered his composure and, assuming a jovial air, cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Adipati! Susuhunan! Sultan of Patjaram! Sugar-lord!
How are you, my god of beauty, the ruin of all good women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His jovial torrent of greetings continued without ceasing, while he
scrambled the papers together and made a sign to the Arab, who
disappeared through the other door, at the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s that with you, Raden Mas Adrianus, my bonnie
Lucius?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your little brother,&rdquo; said Addie.</p>
<p>Si-Oudijck looked up suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is it really?&rdquo; said he, speaking broken Dutch,
Javanese and Malay in the same breath. &ldquo;I can see it is: my
legitimate one. And what does the fellow want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s come to see what you&rsquo;re like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two brothers looked at each other: Theo inquisitively, rejoicing
at having made this discovery, as a weapon against the old man, if the
weapon ever became necessary; the other, Si-Oudijck, secretly
restraining, behind his brown, crafty, leering face, all his jealousy,
all his bitterness and hatred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this where you live?&rdquo; asked Theo, for the sake of
saying something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m just staying with her for the time <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>being,&rdquo; replied Si-Oudijck, with a jerk of
his head towards the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has your mother been dead long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yours is still alive, isn&rsquo;t she? She lives in
Batavia. I know her. Do you ever see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m&#8202;&hellip;. Prefer your step-mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty well,&rdquo; said Theo, drily. And, changing the
subject, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe the old man knows that you
exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. Have you ever spoken to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, formerly. Years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use. He says I&rsquo;m not his son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be difficult to prove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Legally, yes. But it&rsquo;s a fact and everybody knows it.
It&rsquo;s known all over Ngadjiwa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no sort of evidence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the oath which my mother took when she was dying, before
witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, tell me things,&rdquo; said Theo. &ldquo;Walk a bit of
the way with us: it&rsquo;s stuffy in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the hut and sauntered back through the compounds, while
Si-Oudijck told his story. They strolled beside the Brantas, which
wound vaguely in the evening dusk under a sky powdered with stars.</p>
<p>It did Theo good to hear about all this, about that housekeeper of
his father&rsquo;s, in the days of his controllership, dismissed for an
infidelity of which she was guiltless; the child born later and never
recognized, never maintained; the boy wandering from compound to
compound, romantically proud of his inhuman father, whom he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>watched from a distance, following him with his
furtive glance when the father became assistant-resident and resident,
married, divorced his wife and married again; by slow degrees learning
to read and write from a native scrivener of his acquaintance. It did
the legitimate son good to hear about all this, because in his
innermost self, fair-haired and fair-skinned though he might be, he was
more the son of his mother, the half-caste, than of his father; because
in his innermost self he hated his father, not for this or that reason,
but from a secret antipathy in his blood, because, despite the
appearance and behaviour of a fair-haired and fair-skinned European, he
felt a secret kinship for this illegitimate brother, felt a vague
sympathy for him. Were they not both sons of the self-same motherland,
for which their father felt nothing except as a result of his acquired
development, the artificially cultivated, humane love of the ruler for
the territory which he governs. From his childhood Theo had felt like
that, far removed from his father; and later that antipathy had grown
into a slumbering hatred. It gave him pleasure to hear the legend of
his faultless parent demolished; the impeccable, magnanimous man, a
functionary of the highest integrity, who loved his domestic circle,
loved his residency, loved the Javanese, and was anxious to uphold the
regent&rsquo;s family, not only because his official instructions
prescribed that the Javanese nobility should be respected, but because
his own heart told him as much, when he thought of the noble old
pang&eacute;ran&#8202;&hellip;. Theo knew that his father was all this:
blameless, high-minded, upright, magnanimous; and it did him
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>good, here, in the mysterious evening beside the
Brantas, to hear that blamelessness, that high-minded, upright
magnanimity torn to ribbons; it did him good to meet an outcast who in
one moment spattered that high-throned paternal figure with mud and
filth, dragging him from his pedestal, making him appear no higher than
another, sinful, wicked, heartless, mean. It filled him with a wicked
joy, even as he was filled with a wicked joy at possessing his
father&rsquo;s wife, whom his father adored. What to do with this dark
secret he did not yet know, but he clutched at it as a weapon; he was
whetting it there, that very evening, while he listened to the end to
what this furtive-eyed half-caste, ranting and working himself up, had
to say. And Theo hid his secret, hid his weapon deep in his heart.</p>
<p>Grievances rose in his mind; and he too now, the legitimate son,
abused his father; declared that the resident did no more to help him,
his own lawful son, to get on than he would do for any of his clerks;
told him how his father had once recommended him to the manager of an
impossible undertaking, a rice-plantation, where he had been unable to
stay longer than a single month; how afterwards he had left him to his
fate, thwarting him when he went hunting after concessions, even in
other residencies, even in Borneo, until he was now obliged to remain
hanging about and sponging at home, unable to find a job, thanks to his
father, and merely tolerated in that house where he disliked
everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except your step-mother!&rdquo; Si-Oudijck <span class="corr"
id="xd26e2092" title="Source: inter-polated">interpolated</span>,
drily. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span></p>
<p>But Theo went on, growing confidential in his turn and telling his
brother that it would be no great advantage for him even if he were
acknowledged and legitimatized. And in this way they both became
excited, glad to have met each other, to have grown intimate in this
brief hour. And beside them walked Addie, surprised by this quick
mutual attraction, but otherwise empty of thought. They had crossed a
bridge and by a circuitous route had come out behind the Patjaram
factory-buildings. Here Si-Oudijck said good-night, shaking hands with
Theo, who slipped a couple of rix-dollars into his palm. They were
accepted greedily, with a flicker of the furtive glance, but not a word
of thanks. And Addie and Theo went past the factory, now silent, to the
house. The family were strolling, outside, in the garden and in the
tjemara-avenue. And, as the two young men approached, the golden,
eight-year-old child came running towards them, the old
grandmother&rsquo;s little foster-princess, with her fringe of hair and
her whitened forehead, in her rich little, doll-like dress. She came
running up to them and suddenly stopped in front of Addie and looked up
at him. Addie asked her what she wanted, but the child did not answer
and only looked up at him and then, putting out her little hand,
stroked his hand with it. It was all so clearly the result of an
irresistible magnetism in the shy child, this running up, stopping,
looking up and stroking, that Addie laughed aloud and stooped and
kissed her lightly. The child skipped back contentedly. And Theo, still
excited by his evening, first by his conversation with Oorip and then
by his explanation with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href=
"#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>Addie, his meeting with his
half-brother, his own confidences about his father&mdash;Theo, feeling
bitter and interesting, was so greatly irritated by this trivial
behaviour of Addie and the child, that he exclaimed, almost
angrily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you &hellip; you&rsquo;ll never be anything but a
woman&rsquo;s man!&hellip;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">Things had gone well with Van Oudijck upon the
whole. Born of a simple Dutch family, with no money, he had found his
youth a hard though never cruel school of precocious earnestness, of
early strenuous work, of immediate looking forward to the future, to a
career, to the honourable position which he hoped&mdash;with the least
possible delay&mdash;to fill among his fellow-men. His years of
oriental study at Delft had been just gay enough to enable him later to
believe that he had once been young; and, because he had taken part in
a masquerade, he even thought that he had spent quite a dissolute life,
with much squandering of money and riotous living. His character was
based on a good deal of quiet Dutch respectability and an earnest
outlook upon life, a rather gloomy, disillusioned outlook, though
intelligent and practical: he was accustomed to visualize his
honourable position among his fellow-men; and his ambition had
developed rhythmically and steadily into a temperate thirst for
position, but only on the lines along which his eyes were always wont
to gaze: the hierarchical lines of the Indian Civil Service. Things had
always gone well with him. Displaying great capacity, he had been
greatly valued; he had become an assistant-resident earlier than most
and a resident while still young; and his ambition was now really
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>satisfied because his authoritative office was
in complete harmony with his nature, whose love of rule had progressed
with its ambition. He was now really satisfied; and, though his eyes
looked still much farther ahead and saw glimmering before them a seat
on the Indian Council, and even the throne at Buitenzorg, he had days
when, sober and contented, he declared that to become a resident of the
first class&mdash;putting aside the higher pension&mdash;had little in
its favour except at Samarang and Surabaya, but that the Vorstenlanden
were absolutely a burden, while Batavia occupied such a peculiar and
almost derogatory position, in the thick of so many higher officials,
members of council and directors. And, though his eyes thus looked
farther ahead, his practical and temperate nature would have been quite
satisfied if any one should have prophesied to him that he would die as
Resident of Labuwangi. He loved his district and loved India; he never
yearned for Holland, nor for the pageant of European civilization, even
though he himself had remained very Dutch and above all hated anything
that was half-caste. This was the inconsistency in his character, for
he had married his first wife, herself a half-caste, purely out of
affection; and, as for his children, in whom the Indian blood was
eloquent&mdash;outwardly in Doddie, inwardly in Theo, while Ren&eacute;
and Ricus were two thorough little Eurasians&mdash;he loved them with
an intense feeling of paternity, with all the tenderness and sentiment
that slumbered in the depths of his nature: a need to give much and
receive much in the circle of his domestic life. Gradually this need
had extended to the circle of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142"
href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>his district: he took a
paternal pride in his assistant-residents and controllers, among whom
he was popular and beloved. It had happened only once in the six years
during which he had been Resident of Labuwangi that he had been unable
to get on with a controller: then the man was a half-caste, and he had
had him transferred: had him sacked, as he put it. And he was proud
that, despite his strict discipline, despite his stern insistence on
work, he was beloved by his officials. He was all the more grieved by
the constant secret enmity of the regent, his &ldquo;younger
brother,&rdquo; to use the Javanese title, in whom indeed he would
gladly have found a younger brother to govern his native population
under himself, the elder brother. It grieved him that matters had
fallen out thus; and he would then think of other regents, not only of
this one&rsquo;s father, the fine old pang&eacute;ran, but of others
whom he knew: the Regent of D&mdash;&mdash;, a cultivated man, speaking
and writing Dutch correctly, contributing lucid Dutch articles to
newspapers and magazines; the Regent of S&mdash;&mdash;, a trifle
frivolous and vain, but very rich and very benevolent, figuring as a
dandy in European society and polite to the ladies. Why should things
have fallen out just so in Labuwangi, with this silent, spiteful,
secretive, fanatical puppet, with the reputation of a saint and
sorcerer, stupidly idolized by the people, in whose welfare he took no
interest and who adored him only for the glamour of his ancient name, a
man in whom he always felt an antagonism, never uttered in words, but
plainly palpable under his icy correctness of demeanour? And then at
Ngadjiwa too there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143"
name="pb143">143</a>]</span>was the brother, the card-player, the
gambler: why should just he be so unlucky in his regents?</p>
<p>Van Oudijck was in a gloomy mood. He was accustomed to receiving, at
regular intervals, anonymous letters, venomous libels spewed forth from
quiet corners, bespattering at one time an assistant-resident, at
another a controller, besmirching now the native head-men and now his
own family; sometimes taking the form of a friendly warning, sometimes
displaying a malicious delight in wounding; very, very anxious to open
his eyes to the shortcomings of his officials and to his wife&rsquo;s
misconduct. He was so completely used to this that he did not count the
letters, reading them hastily or hardly at all and carelessly
destroying them. Accustomed as he was to judging for himself, these
spiteful warnings made no impression on him, though they reared their
heads like hissing snakes among all the letters which the post brought
him daily; and as regards his wife he was so blind, he had always been
so much in the habit of picturing L&eacute;onie in the tranquillity of
her smiling indifference and in the home-like sociability which she
most certainly attracted round her&mdash;in the hollow void of the
residency, whose chairs and ottomans seemed always arranged for a
reception&mdash;that he could never have credited the most trivial of
all these slanders.</p>
<p>He never mentioned them to her. He loved his wife; he was in love
with her; and, as he always saw her almost silent in society, as she
never flirted or coquetted, he never glanced into the slough of
corruption that was her soul. At home, indeed, he was absolutely blind.
At home he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>displayed that utter blindness which is often
seen in men who are very capable and efficient in their business or
profession; who are accustomed to scan with sharp eyes the wide
perspective of their official duties, but who are near-sighted at home;
who are wont to analyse things in the lump, but not their psychological
details; whose knowledge of mankind is based on principles, and who
divide mankind into types, as in the caste of an old-fashioned play;
who can at once plumb the capacity of their subordinates, but are
utterly unable to realize the intricate complex, like a tangled
arabesque, like rankly-growing tendrils, of the psychic involution of
those who form their own household: always gazing over their heads,
failing to grasp the inner meaning of their speech, and taking no
interest in the kaleidoscopic emotions of hatred and jealousy and life
and love that shine with prismatic hues right before their eyes. He
loved his wife and he loved his children, because the feeling and the
fact of paternity were necessities of his being; but he knew neither
his wife nor his children. He knew nothing about L&eacute;onie; and he
had never realized that Theo and Doddie had secretly remained faithful
to their mother, so far away in Batavia, ruined by her unspeakable mode
of life, and that they felt no love for him. He thought that they did
give him their love; and, as for him &hellip; when he thought of them,
a slumbering affection awoke within him.</p>
<p>He received these anonymous letters daily. They had never made an
impression on him; yet of late he no longer destroyed them, but read
them attentively and put them aside in a secret drawer. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>He
could not have said why. They contained accusations against his wife,
they contained imputations against his daughter. They sought to
intimidate him by threatening that he might be stabbed in the dark.
They warned him that his spies were utterly untrustworthy. They told
him that his divorced wife was suffering from poverty and hated him,
they told him that he had a son whom he had left unprovided for. They
stealthily grubbed up all the secret or obscure passages in his life
and his career. The thing depressed his spirits in spite of himself. It
was all very vague; and he had nothing with which to reproach himself.
In his own eyes and the world&rsquo;s, he was a good official, a good
husband and a good father, he was a good man. That he should be blamed
for having judged too unjustly and unfairly here, for having acted
cruelly there, for having divorced his first wife, for having a son
running wild in the compound; that people should throw mud at
L&eacute;onie and Doddie: it all depressed him nowadays. For it was
unaccountable that people should do just this. To this man, with his
practical good sense, the vagueness was just the most vexatious part of
it. He would not fear an open fight, but this mock battle in the dark
was upsetting his nerves and his health. He could not conceive why it
was happening. There was nothing to tell him. He could not conjure up
the face of an enemy. And the letters came day after day; and enmity
lurked daily in the shadows about him. It was too mystical and too much
opposed to his nature not to embitter and depress and sadden him. Then
paragraphs appeared in the lesser papers, utterances <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>of a
mean and hostile press, vague accusations or palpable falsehoods.
Hatred was seething all about him. He could not fathom the reason of
it, he became ill from brooding over it. And he discussed it with
nobody and hid his suffering deep down within himself.</p>
<p>He did not understand it. He could not imagine why it was, why it
should be so. There was no logic in it all. Logically he should be
loved, not hated, however strict and authoritative he might be
considered. Indeed, did he not often temper his authoritative
strictness with the jovial laugh under his thick moustache, with a
friendly, genial warning and exhortation? Was he not on circuit a
pleasant resident, who regarded the circuit with his officials as a
relaxation, as a delightful trip on horseback through the
coffee-plantations, touching at the go-downs in each; as a jolly
excursion, which relaxed one&rsquo;s muscles after all those weeks of
office-work: the big staff of district heads following on their little
horses, riding their skittish animals like nimble monkeys, with flags
in their hands; with the native orchestra tinkling out its blithe
crystal notes of welcome wherever he went; with the carefully prepared
dinner in the dak-bungalow in the evening and the rubber till late at
night? Had not his officials, in informal moments, told him that he was
a regular sport of a resident, an indefatigable rider, jovial at meals
and so young that he would actually take the scarf from the nautch-girl
and dance with her for a moment, very cleverly performing the lissom
ritual movements of the hands and feet and hips, instead of buying
himself off with a rix-dollar and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147"
href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>leaving her to dance with the
district head? Never did he feel so happy as on circuit. And now that
he was gloomy and depressed, dissatisfied, not knowing what hidden
forces were opposing him in the dusk&mdash;straight, honest man that he
was, a man of simple principles, a serious worker&mdash;he thought that
he would go on circuit soon and, by that diversion, rid himself of the
gloom that was oppressing him. He would ask Theo to go with him, for
the sake of a few days&rsquo; change.</p>
<p>He was fond of his boy, even though he considered him stupid,
thoughtless, reckless, lacking in perseverance, never satisfied with
his superiors, tactlessly opposing his manager, until he had once more
made himself impossible in the coffee-plantation or sugar-factory at
which he happened to be employed. He considered that Theo ought to make
his own way, as his father had done before him, instead of relying
entirely on the resident&rsquo;s protection. He did not hold with
nepotism. He would never favour his son above any one else who had the
same rights. He had often told nephews of his, keen on obtaining
concessions in Labuwangi, that he would rather have no relations in his
district and that they must expect nothing from him except absolute
impartiality. That was how he had got on; that was how he expected them
to get on &hellip; and Theo too. Nevertheless, he silently watched
Theo, with all a father&rsquo;s love, with an almost sentimental
tenderness; he regretted, silently but profoundly, that Theo was not
more persevering and did not look more closely to his future, to his
career, to an honourable situation among his fellow-men, from the
standpoint <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>of either money or position. The lad just lived
from day to day, without a thought of the morrow&#8202;&hellip;.
Perhaps he was a little cold to Theo, outwardly: well, he would have a
confidential talk with him some day, would advise him; and now, in any
case, he would ask Theo to go with him on circuit.</p>
<p>And the thought of riding for five or six days in the pure air of
the mountains, through the coffee-plantations, inspecting the
irrigation-works, doing what most of all attracted him in his official
duties, the thought of this relieved his soul, brightened his outlook,
till he ceased to think about the letters. He was made for a plain,
simple life: he found life natural, not complex and involved; his life
had followed a perceptible ascent, open and gradual, looking out
towards a glittering summit of ambition; and the things that teemed and
swarmed in the shadow and the darkness, the things that bubbled up from
the abyss: these he had never been able or anxious to see. He was blind
to the life that underlies the visible life. He did not believe in it,
any more than a mountaineer who has lived long on a quiescent volcano
believes in the inner fire which persists in its mysterious depths and
which escapes only in the form of hot steam and a sulphurous stench. He
believed neither in the force above things nor in the force of things
themselves. He did not believe in dumb fate nor in silent
inevitability. He believed only in what he saw with his own eyes: in
the harvest, in the roads, districts and villages and in the welfare of
his province; he believed only in his career, which he saw before
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>him like an ascending path. And, in the
unclouded clarity of his simple, masculine nature, in the universally
perceptible obviousness of his upright love of authority, his
legitimate ambition and his practical sense of duty, there was only one
weak point: his affection, his deep, almost effeminate, sentimental
affection for the members of his domestic circle &hellip; into whose
soul he could not see, being blind and seeing only in the light of his
fixed principle, seeing his wife and children as they <i>ought</i> to
be.</p>
<p>Experience had taught him nothing. For he had loved his first wife
also as he now loved L&eacute;onie&#8202;&hellip;. He loved his wife
because she was his wife, because she belonged to him, because she was
the principal person in his circle. He loved the circle as such and not
as so many individuals who formed its links. Experience had taught him
nothing. His thoughts were not in accordance with the changing hues of
his life; they accorded with his ideas and principles. They had made a
man and a force of him and also a good official. They had also allowed
him as a rule to be a good man, according to his lights. But, because
he possessed so much affection, unconscious, unanalysed and merely very
deeply felt, and because he did not believe in the hidden force, in the
life within life, in the force that teemed and swarmed like volcanic
fires under the mountains of majesty, like troubles under a throne,
because he did not believe in the mysticism of tangible things, life
sometimes found him weak and unprepared when, serene as the gods and
more powerful than men, it deviated from what he regarded as logical.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">The mysticism of concrete things in that
island of mystery which is Java!&hellip; Outwardly the docile colony
with the subject race, which was no match for the rude trader who, in
the golden age of his republic, with the young strength of a youthful
people, greedy and eager for gain, stout and phlegmatic, planted his
foot and his flag on the crumbling empires, on the thrones which
tottered as though the earth had been in seismic labour. But, deep in
its soul, it was never subjected, though smiling in proud, contemptuous
resignation and bowing submissively beneath its fate; deep in its soul,
despite a cringing reverence, it lived in freedom its own mysterious
life, hidden from western eyes, however these might seek to fathom the
secret&mdash;as though with a philosophic intention of maintaining
before all a proud and smiling tranquillity, pliantly yielding and to
all appearances courteously approaching&mdash;but deep within itself
divinely certain of its own views and so far removed from all its
rulers&rsquo; ideals of civilization that no fraternization between
master and servant will ever take place, because the difference which
ferments in soul and blood remains insuperable. And the European, proud
in his might, in his strength, in his civilization and his humanity,
rules arrogantly, blindly, selfishly, egoistically, amidst all the
intricate cog-wheels of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href=
"#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>his authority, which he slips into
gear with the certainty of clockwork, controlling its every movement,
till to the foreigner, the outside observer, this overlordship of
tangible things, this colonizing of territory alien in race and mind,
appears a masterpiece, a very world created.</p>
<p>But beneath all this show the hidden force lurks, slumbering now and
unwilling to fight. Beneath all this appearance of tangible things the
essence of that silent mysticism threatens, like a smouldering fire
underground, like hatred and mystery in the heart. Beneath all this
peace of grandeur the danger threatens and the future mutters like the
subterranean thunder in the volcanoes, inaudible to human ears. And it
is as though the subject race knew it and were leaving matters to the
latent force of things and awaiting the divine moment that is to come
if there be any truth in the calculations of the mystics. As for the
native, he reads his overlord with a single penetrating glance; he sees
in him the illusion of civilization and humanity and he knows that they
are non-existent. While he gives him the title of lord and the homage
due to the master, he is profoundly conscious of his democratic,
commercial nature and despises him for it in silence and judges him
with a smile which his brother understands; and he too smiles. Never
does he offend against the form of slavish servility; and, with his
salaam, he acts as though he were the inferior, but he is silently
aware that he is the superior. He is conscious of the hidden, unuttered
force; he feels the mystery borne upon the surging winds of his
mountains, in the silence of the secret, sultry nights; and he foresees
events <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>that are as yet remote. What is will not always
be; the present is disappearing. Dumbly he hopes that God will lift up
those who are oppressed, some time, some time in the distant advent of
the dawning future. But he feels and hopes and knows it in the
innermost depths of his soul, which he never unlocks to his ruler,
which he would not even be able to unlock, which always remains an
indecipherable book, in the unknown, untranslatable tongue in which the
words indeed are the same but the shades of meaning expressed by them
are different and in which the manifold hues of the two ideals show
different spectra: spectra in which the colours differ as though given
forth by two separate suns, rays from two separate worlds. And never is
there the harmony that understands; never does that love blossom forth
which is conscious of unity; and between the two there is always the
gap, the chasm, the abyss, the distance, the width whence looms the
mystery wherefrom, as from a cloud, the hidden force will one day flash
forth&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>So it was that Van Oudijck did not feel the mysticism of tangible
things.</p>
<p>And the serene life, as of the gods, might well find him weak and
unprepared&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href=

<p class="first dropcap">Ngadjiwa was a gayer place than Labuwangi:
there was a garrison; managers and employers often came down from the
coffee-plantations in the interior for a few days&rsquo; amusement;
there were races twice a year, accompanied by festivities which filled
a whole month: the reception of the resident, a horse-raffle, a battle
of flowers and an opera, two or three balls, distinguished by the
revellers as the fancy-dress ball, the ceremonial ball and the <i lang=
"fr">soir&eacute;e dansante</i>; it was a time of early rising and late
retiring, of losing hundreds of guilders in a few days at
&eacute;cart&eacute; and in the totalizator&#8202;&hellip;. The longing
for pleasure and the cheery joy of life were freely indulged during
those days; coffee-planters and young men from the sugar-factories
looked forward to them for months ahead; people saved up for them
during half the year. The two hotels were filled with guests from all
directions, every household entertained its visitors; people betted
furiously, while champagne flowed in torrents, all, including the
ladies, knowing the race-horses as thoroughly as though they were their
own property, feeling quite at home at the dances, everybody knowing
everybody, as at family-parties, while the waltzes and Washington Posts
and <i>grazianas</i> were danced with the languorous grace of the
Eurasian dancers, to a swooning measure, the trains gently floating,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>a smile of quiet rapture on the parted lips,
with that dreamy voluptuousness which the Indian settlers express so
charmingly in their dances, especially those who have Javanese blood in
their veins. Dancing with them is not a rough diversion, all bumping
against one another with rude leaps and loud laughter, not the wild
whirl of the Lancers as at Dutch boy-and-girl balls, but represents,
especially to the Eurasians, nothing but courtesy and grace: a serene
blossoming of the poetry of motion; a gracefully designed curve of
precise steps to a pure measure over the club-room floors; an almost
eighteenth-century harmony of youthful nobility, waving and trailing
and swaying in the dance, despite the primitive boom-booming of the
Indian musicians. This was how Addie de Luce danced, with the eyes of
every woman and girl fixed upon him, following him, imploring him with
their glances to take them with him also in that waving and undulating
motion; which was like a dream upon the water&#8202;&hellip;. This came
to him with his mother&rsquo;s blood, this was a survival of the grace
of the dancing princesses among whom his mother had spent her
childhood; and the mingling of modern European and ancient Javanese
gave him an irresistible charm.</p>
<p>And now, at the last ball, the <i lang="fr">soir&eacute;e
dansante</i>, he danced like this with Doddie and, after her, with
L&eacute;onie. It was late at night, or rather early in the morning:
the day was dawning outside. A fatigue hung over the ball-room; and Van
Oudijck at last intimated to the assistant-resident, Vermalen, with
whom he and his family were staying, that he was ready to go home. At
that moment he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>was in the front verandah of the club, talking
to Vermalen, when the native councillor suddenly ran up to him from the
shadow of the garden and, suffering from obvious excitement, squatted,
salaamed and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency! Excellency! Please advise me, tell me what to do!
The regent is drunk, he is walking along the street and forgetting all
his dignity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guests were taking their departure. The carriages drove up; the
owners stepped in; the carriages drove away. In the road outside the
club the resident saw a Javanese: the upper part of the man&rsquo;s
body was bare; he had lost his head-dress; and his long, black hair
floated loosely, while he talked aloud, with violent gestures. Groups
gathered in the dusky shadow, looking on from a distance.</p>
<p>Van Oudijck recognized the Regent of Ngadjiwa. Already at the ball
the regent had behaved without self-control, after losing heavily at
cards and mixing all sorts of wines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t the regent been home yet?&rdquo; asked Van
Oudijck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, excellency!&rdquo; replied the councillor,
plaintively. &ldquo;I took the regent home as soon as I saw that he was
no longer able to control himself. He flung himself on his bed; I
thought he was sound asleep. But see, he woke and got up; he left the
palace and came back here. See how he&rsquo;s behaving! He is drunk, he
is drunk and he forgets who he is and who his fathers were!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Oudijck went outside with Vermalen. He walked up to the regent,
who was making <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>violent gestures and delivering an
unintelligible speech in a loud voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regent!&rdquo; said the resident. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know
where and who you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The regent did not recognize him. He ranted at Van Oudijck, he
called down all the curses of heaven upon his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regent!&rdquo; said the assistant-resident.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know who&rsquo;s speaking to you and to whom
you&rsquo;re speaking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The regent swore at Vermalen. His bloodshot eyes flashed with
drunken fury and madness. Assisted by the councillor, Van Oudijck and
Vermalen tried to help him into a carriage; but he refused. Splendid
and sublime in his fall, he gloried in the madness of his tragedy, he
stood, as though some explosive force had made him beside himself,
half-naked, with floating hair and great gestures of his crazy arms. He
was no longer coarse and bestial but became tragic, heroic, fighting
against his fate, on the edge of the abyss&#8202;&hellip;. The excess
of his drunkenness seemed with a strange force to raise him out of his
gradual bestialization; and, fuddled as he was, he drew himself up,
towering high, dramatically, above the Europeans.</p>
<p>Van Oudijck gazed at him in stupefaction. The regent was now coming
to blows with the councillor, who addressed him in beseeching tones. On
the road, the population collected, silent, dismayed; the last guests
were leaving the club, where the lights were growing dim. Among them
were L&eacute;onie van Oudijck, Doddie and Addie de Luce. All three
still bore in their eyes the weary voluptuousness of the last waltz.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Addie,&rdquo; said the resident, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re an
intimate friend of the regent&rsquo;s. Just see if he knows
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man spoke to the tipsy madman, in soft Javanese accents.
At first the regent kept on with his words of objurgation, with his
gigantic, raving gestures; then, however, the softness of the language
seemed to hold a well-known memory for him. He gave Addie a long look.
His gestures subsided, his drunken glory evaporated. It was as though
his blood suddenly understood that young man&rsquo;s blood, as though
their souls recognized each other. The regent nodded dolefully and
began a long lament, with his arms raised on high. Addie tried to help
him into a carriage, but the regent resisted and refused. Then Addie
took his arm in his own with gentle force and walked on with him
slowly. The regent, still lamenting, with tragic gestures of despair,
suffered himself to be led. The councillor followed with one or two
underlings, who had run after the regent out of the palace, helplessly.
The procession vanished in the darkness.</p>
<p>L&eacute;onie, wearily smiling, stepped into the
assistant-resident&rsquo;s carriage. She remembered the
gambling-quarrel at Patjaram; she took pleasure in observing the
gradual deterioration which was occurring so visibly, this visible
degradation by a passion controlled by neither tact nor moderation. And
where she was concerned she felt stronger than ever, because she
enjoyed her passions and controlled them and made them the slaves of
her enjoyment&#8202;&hellip;. She despised the regent; and it gave her
a romantic satisfaction, an artistic pleasure, to watch the successive
phases of that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>deterioration. In the carriage she glanced at
her husband, who sat in gloomy silence. And his gloom delighted her,
because she thought him sentimental, with his championing of the
Javanese nobility, the result of a sentimental instruction, which Van
Oudijck took even more sentimentally. And she delighted in his sorrow.
And from her husband she glanced at Doddie, detecting in the
dance-weary eyes of her step-daughter a jealousy due to that last, that
very last waltz of L&eacute;onie&rsquo;s with Addie. And she rejoiced
in this jealousy. She felt happy, because sorrow had no hold upon her,
any more than passion. She played with the things of life and they
glided off her and left her as unperturbed and calmly smiling and
unwrinkled and creamy white as before.</p>
<p>Van Oudijck did not go to bed. With his head aflame, with a fury of
mortification in his heart, he at once took a bath, dressed himself in
pyjamas and had coffee served on the verandah outside his room. It was
six o&rsquo;clock; the air was steeped in a delightful coolness of
morning freshness. But he suffered from so fierce an anger that his
temples throbbed as though with congestion, his heart thumped in his
chest, his every nerve quivered. The scene of that night and morning
was still flickering before his eyes, ticking on like a cinematograph,
with whirling changes of posture. What angered him above all was the
impossibility of it all, the illogicality, the unthinkableness of it.
That a Javanese of high birth, forgetful of all the noble traditions in
his blood, should have been able to behave as the Regent of Ngadjiwa
had behaved that night would never have seemed to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>him
possible. He would never have believed it, if he had not seen it with
his own eyes. To this man of predetermined logic the fact was simply
monstrous, like a nightmare. Extremely susceptible to surprise, which
he did not consider logical, he was angry with reality. He wondered
whether he had not been dreaming, whether he himself had not been
drunk. That the scandal should have occurred made him furious. But, as
it was so, well, he would recommend the regent for dismissal. There was
no alternative.</p>
<p>He dressed, spoke to Vermalen and went to the palace with him. They
both forced their way in to the regent, notwithstanding the hesitation
of the retainers, notwithstanding the breach of etiquette. They did not
see the wife, the raden-aju. But they found the regent in his bedroom.
He was lying on his bed, with his eyes open, recovering gloomily, not
yet sufficiently restored to life fully to realize the strangeness of
this visit, of the presence of the resident and assistant-resident by
his bedside. He recognized them nevertheless, but did not speak. While
the two of them tried to bring home to him the gross impropriety of his
behaviour, he stared shamelessly in their faces and persisted in his
silence. It was all so strange that the two officials looked at each
other and exchanged glances to ask whether the regent was not mad,
whether he was really responsible. He had not spoken a single word, he
remained silent. Though Van Oudijck threatened him with dismissal, he
remained dumb, staring with shameless eyes into the resident&rsquo;s
eyes. He did not open his lips, he maintained the attitude <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>of a
deaf-mute. At the most, an ironical smile formed about his lips. The
officials, really thinking that the regent was mad, shrugged their
shoulders and left the room.</p>
<p>In the gallery they met the raden-aju, a short, downtrodden little
woman, like a whipped dog, a beaten slave. She approached, weeping; she
begged, she implored for forgiveness. Van Oudijck told her that the
regent refused to speak, for all his threats, that he was silent with
an inexplicable but obviously deliberate silence. Then the raden-aju
whispered that the regent had consulted a native physician, who had
given him a talisman and assured him that, if he only persisted in
maintaining complete silence, his enemies would obtain no hold upon
him. Terrified, she implored for help, for forgiveness, gathering her
children round her as she spoke. After sending for the councillor and
enjoining him to keep a strict watch on the regent, the two officials
went away.</p>
<p>Often though Van Oudijck had encountered the superstition of the
Javanese, it always enraged him, as opposed to what he called the laws
of nature and life. Yes, nothing but his superstition could induce a
Javanese to depart from the correct path of his innate courtliness.
Whatever they might now wish to put before him, the regent would remain
silent, would persist in the absolute silence prescribed by the
physician. In this way he believed himself protected against those whom
he considered his enemies. And this preconceived notion of hostility in
one whom he would so gladly have regarded as his younger brother and
fellow-ruler was what disturbed Van Oudijck most of all. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span></p>
<p>He returned to Labuwangi with L&eacute;onie and Doddie. Once at
home, he felt for a moment the pleasantness of being back in his own
house, an enjoyment of domesticity that always soothed him greatly: the
material pleasure of seeing his own bed again, his own writing-table
and chair, of drinking his own coffee, made as he was accustomed to
have it. These minor amenities put him in a good humour for a little
while, but he at once felt all his bitterness awaken when he perceived,
under a pile of letters on his desk, the disguised handwritings of a
couple of furtive correspondents. Automatically he opened these first
and felt sick when he read L&eacute;onie&rsquo;s name coupled with that
of Theo. Nothing was sacred to those scoundrels: they concocted the
most monstrous calumnies, the most unnatural libels, the most loathsome
imputations, down to that of what was almost incest. All the filth
flung at his wife and son only set them higher in his love, girt them
with a greater purity, placed them on an inviolable summit and made him
cherish them with a deeper and more fervent affection. But his
bitterness, once stirred up, brought back all his mortification. Its
actual cause was that he had to propose the Regent of Ngadjiwa&rsquo;s
dismissal and did not enjoy the prospect. But this one necessity
embittered his whole being, upset his nerves and made him ill. If he
could not follow the path which he had determined upon, if life strayed
from the possibilities which he, Van Oudijck, had <i>a priori</i>
fixed, this reluctance, this rebellion upset his nerves and made him
ill.</p>
<p>He had once and for all resolved, after the death <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>of
the old pang&eacute;ran, to raise up the declining race of the
Adiningrats, alike because of his affectionate memory of that excellent
Javanese prince, because of his instructions as resident and because of
a sense of lofty humanity and hidden poetry in himself. And he had
never been able to do so, he had at once been
thwarted&mdash;unconsciously, by force of circumstances&mdash;by the
old raden-aju pang&eacute;ran, who gambled away everything, who was
ruining herself and her kin. As a friend he had exhorted her. She had
always been accessible to his advice, but her passion had proved too
strong for her. Van Oudijck had from the first, even before the
father&rsquo;s death, judged her son, Sunario, the Regent of Labuwangi,
unfitted for the actual position of regent. The fellow was petty and
insignificant, insufferably proud of his descent, never in touch with
the actualities of life, devoid of any talent for ruling or any
consideration for his inferiors, a great fanatic, always occupied with
native doctors, with sacred calculations, with talismans, always
reticent and living in a dream of obscure mysticism and blind to what
would spell welfare and justice for his Javanese subjects. And the
population adored him nevertheless, both because of his noble birth and
because he was reputed to possess sanctity and a far-reaching power, a
divine magic. Silently, secretly, the women of the Kabupaten sold
bottles of the water that had flowed over his body in the bath, as a
healing remedy for various diseases. There you had the elder brother;
and the younger had quite forgotten himself last night, frenzied by
cards and drink. In these two sons the once so brilliant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>race
was tottering to its fall. Their children were young; a few cousins
were native councillors in Labuwangi and the adjoining residencies, but
their veins contained not a drop of the noble blood. No, Van Oudijck
had always failed, glad though he would have been to succeed. The very
men whose interests he defended were opposing his efforts. Their day
was over. But why this must be so he could not understand; and it all
upset him and embittered him.</p>
<p>And he had pictured to himself a very different path, a beautiful
ascending path, even as he saw his own life before him, whereas with
them the path of life wound tortuously downwards. And he did not
understand what it was that was stronger than he when he put forth his
will. Had it not always happened in his life and his career that the
things for which he had fervently wished came to pass with the logic
which he himself, day after day, had attributed to the things that were
about to take place? His ambition had now established the logic of the
ascending path, for his ambition had established as its aim the revival
of this Javanese family&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Would he fail? To fail in striving for an aim which he had set
himself as an official: he would never forgive himself! Hitherto he had
always succeeded in achieving what he had willed. But what he now
wanted to achieve was, unknown to himself, not merely an official aim,
a part of his work. What he now wanted to achieve was an aim the idea
of which sprang from his humanity, from the noblest part of himself.
What he now wanted to achieve was an ideal, the ideal of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>European in the east and of the European who
sees the east as he wishes to see it and as he could but see it.</p>
<p>And that there were forces that gathered into one force, which
threatened him, mocking at his proposals, laughing at his ideals, and
which was all the stronger through lying more deeply hidden: this he
would never admit. It was not in him to acknowledge them; and even the
clearest revelation of them would be a riddle to his soul and would
remain a myth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">Van Oudijck had been to the
government-building that day. L&eacute;onie met him the moment he
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The raden-aju pang&eacute;ran is here,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;She has been here quite an hour, Otto. She wishes to speak to
you badly. She has been waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&eacute;onie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want you to look
through these letters. I often get libels of this sort and I&rsquo;ve
never mentioned them to you. But perhaps it&rsquo;s better that you
should not be left in ignorance. Perhaps it&rsquo;s better for you to
know. But please don&rsquo;t take them to heart. I needn&rsquo;t assure
you that I don&rsquo;t for a moment believe one word of all this filth.
So don&rsquo;t get upset about it and give me back the letters
presently yourself. Don&rsquo;t leave them lying about&#8202;&hellip;.
And send the raden-aju pang&eacute;ran to my
office&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>L&eacute;onie, carrying the letters in her hand, went to the
back-verandah and returned with the princess, a distinguished-looking,
grey-haired woman, with a proud, royal bearing in her still slender
figure. Her eyes were a sombre black; her mouth, which was widened in
outline by betel-nut-juice and which grinned with filed, black,
lacquered teeth, was like a grimacing mask and spoilt the proud
nobility of her expression. She wore a black satin kabaai fastened with
jewelled buttons. It was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>above all her grey hair and her
sombre eyes that gave her a peculiar admixture of venerable dignity and
smouldering passion. Tragedy hung over her old age. She herself felt
that fate was pressing tragically upon her and hers; and she placed her
only hope in the far-reaching, divinely-appointed power of her
first-born, Sunario, the Regent of Labuwangi.</p>
<p>While the old princess preceded Van Oudijck into the office,
L&eacute;onie examined the letters in the middle gallery. They were
lampoons couched in foul language, about her and Addie and Theo. Always
wrapped in the selfish dream of her own life, she never troubled
greatly about what people thought or said, especially as she knew that
she could always and immediately win every one again with her
personality, with her smile. She possessed a tranquil charm which was
irresistible. She herself never spoke ill of others, out of
indifference; she made amiable excuses for everything and everybody;
and she was loved &hellip; when people saw her. But she considered
these dirty letters, spat out from some dark corner, tiresome and
unpleasant, even though Van Oudijck did not believe them. Suppose that
one day he began to believe things? She must be prepared for it. She
must above all retain for that possible day her most charming
tranquillity, all her invulnerability, all her inviolability. Who could
have sent the letters? Who hated her so much, who could be interested
in writing like this to her husband? How strange that the thing should
be known!&hellip; Addie? Theo? How did people know? Was it Oorip? No,
not Oorip&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href=
"#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>But who then? And was everything
actually known? She had always thought that what happened in the secret
chambers would never be known on the housetops. She had even
believed&mdash;it was simple of her&mdash;that the men never discussed
her with one another, that they might discuss other women, but not
herself. Her mind harboured such simple illusions, despite all her
experience, in a simplicity which harmonized with the half-perverse,
half-childish poetry of her rose-hued imagination. Could she then not
always keep hidden the secrets of her mystery, the secrets of reality?
It annoyed her for a moment, that reality, which was being revealed
despite her superficial correctness&#8202;&hellip;. Thoughts and dreams
always remained secret. It was the actions that were so troublesome.
For an instant she thought of being more careful in future, of
refraining. But she saw before her, in imagination, Theo and Addie, her
fair love and her dark love; and she felt that she was too weak for
that. She knew that in this she could not conquer her passions, though
she controlled them. Would they end by proving her destruction,
notwithstanding all her tactfulness? But she laughed at the thought:
she had a firm faith in her invulnerability. Life always glided off her
shoulders.</p>
<p>Still she wanted to prepare herself for what might happen. She had
no higher ideal in life than to be free from pain, free from grief,
free from poverty and to make her passions the slaves of her enjoyment,
so that she might possess this enjoyment as long as possible, lead this
life as long as possible. She reflected what she should say
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>and do if Van Oudijck suddenly questioned her,
suspicious because of these anonymous letters. She reflected whether
she had better break with Theo. Addie was enough for her. And she lost
herself in her calculations, as in the vague combinations of a play
about to be enacted. Then, suddenly, she heard the raden-aju
pang&eacute;ran&rsquo;s voice sounding loudly in the office, in between
her husband&rsquo;s calmer accents. She listened, inquisitively,
foreseeing a tragedy, and was quietly relieved that this tragedy also
was gliding away from her. She crept into Van Oudijck&rsquo;s bedroom;
the communicating-doors were always left open for coolness and only a
screen separated the bedroom from the office. She peeped past the
screen. And she saw the old princess more greatly excited than she had
ever seen any Javanese woman. The raden-aju was beseeching Van Oudijck
in Malay; he was assuring her in Dutch that what she asked was
impossible. L&eacute;onie listened more closely. And she now heard the
old princess imploring the resident to show mercy to her second son,
the Regent of Ngadjiwa. She entreated Van Oudijck to remember her
husband, the pang&eacute;ran, whom he had loved as a father, who had
loved him as a son, with a mutual affection more intense than that of
an &ldquo;elder and younger brother&rdquo;; she conjured him to think
of their famous past, of the glory of the Adiningrats, ever loyal
friends of the Company, its allies in war, its most faithful vassals in
peace; she conjured him not to decree the downfall of their race, on
which a doom had descended since the pang&eacute;ran&rsquo;s death,
driving it into an abyss of fatal destruction. She stood <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>before the resident like a Niobe, like a tragic
mother, flinging up her arms in the vehemence of her protestations,
while tears poured from her sombre eyes and only the wide mouth,
painted with brown betel-juice, was like the grimace of a mask. But
from this grimace the fluent phrases of protestation and conjuration
were pouring forth; and she wrung her hands in entreaty and beat her
breast in contrition.</p>
<p>Van Oudijck answered in a firm but gentle voice, telling her that
certainly he had loved the old pang&eacute;ran most sincerely, that he
respected the old race highly, that no one would be better pleased than
he to uphold their lofty position. But then he grew more severe and
asked her whom the Adiningrats had to blame for the fate that was now
pursuing her. And, with his eyes looking into hers, he said that it was
she! She fell back, flaring up with rage; but he repeated it again and
yet again. Her sons were <i>her</i> children: bigoted and proud and
incurable gamblers. And it was gambling, that low passion, which was
wrecking their greatness. Their race was staggering to its downfall
through their insatiable greed of gain. How often did it not happen
that a month went by at Ngadjiwa before the regent paid the native
heads their salaries? She protested that it was true: it was at
<i>her</i> instigation that her son had taken the money of the
treasury, to pay gambling debts. But she also swore that it would never
happen again. And where, asked Van Oudijck, had a regent, descended
from an ancient race, ever behaved as the Regent of Ngadjiwa had at the
race-ball? The mother <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href=
"#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>lamented: it was true, it was
true; fate dogged their footsteps and had clouded her son&rsquo;s mind;
but it would never, never happen again. She swore by the soul of the
old pang&eacute;ran that it would never happen again, that her son
would win back his dignity. But Van Oudijck grew more vehement and
reproached her with never having exercised a good influence over her
sons and nephews, with being the evil genius of her family, because a
demon of gambling and greed held her fast in its claws. She began to
shriek with anguish, she, the old princess, who looked down upon the
resident, the Hollander without birth or breeding, shrieking with
anguish because he dared to speak like this and was entitled to do so.
She flung out her arms, she begged for mercy; she begged him not to
urge her son&rsquo;s dismissal by the government, which would act as
the resident suggested, which would follow the advice of such a highly
esteemed official; she begged him to have pity and show patience a
little longer. She would speak to her son; Sunario would speak to his
brother; they would bring him back to his senses, which had been
bewildered by drink and play and women. Oh, if the resident would only
have pity, if he would only relent! But Van Oudijck remained
inexorable. He had shown patience for so long. It was now exhausted.
Since her son, at the instigation of the native physician, relying on
his talisman, had resisted him with his insolent silence, which, as he
firmly believed, made him invulnerable to his enemies, he would prove
that he, the spokesman of the government, the representative of the
queen, was the stronger, physician and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>talisman
notwithstanding. There was no alternative: his patience was at an end;
his love for the pang&eacute;ran did not allow of further indulgence;
his feeling of respect for their race was not such that he could
transfer it to an unworthy son. It was settled: the regent would be
dismissed.</p>
<p>The princess had listened to him, unable to credit his words, seeing
the abyss yawn before her. And, with a yell like that of a wounded
lioness, with a scream of pain, she pulled the jewelled hairpins from
her head, till her long grey hair fell streaming about her face; with a
rending tug she tore open her satin kabaai; beside herself with
anguish, she threw herself before the feet of the European, took firm
hold of his foot with her two hands, planted it, with a movement which
made Van Oudijck stagger, on her bowed neck and cried aloud and
screamed that she, the daughter of the sultans of Madura, would for
ever be his slave, that she swore to be nothing but his slave, if only
he would have mercy on her son this time and not plunge her house into
the abyss of shame which she saw yawning around her. And she clutched
the European&rsquo;s foot, as though with the strength of despair, and
held that foot, like a yoke of servitude, with the sole and heel of the
shoe pressed upon her flowing grey hair, upon her neck bowed to the
floor. Van Oudijck trembled with emotion. He realized that this
high-spirited woman would never humble herself like that, with evident
spontaneity, to the lowest depths of humiliation that she could
conceive, would not resort to the most vehement utterance of actual
grief that a woman could ever display, with her <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>hair
unbound and the ruler&rsquo;s foot planted on her neck, if she had not
been shaken to the very depths of her soul, if she did not feel
desperate to the pitch of self-destruction. And he hesitated for a
moment. But only for a moment. He was a man of considered principles,
of fixed, <i>a priori</i> logic, immovable when he had come to a
decision, wholly inaccessible to impulse. With the utmost respect, he
at last released his foot from the princess&rsquo; clinging grasp.
Holding out both hands to her, with visible compassion, visible
emotion, he raised her from the floor. He made her sit down; and she
fell into a chair, broken, sobbing aloud. For a moment, perceiving his
gentleness, she thought that she had won. But when he calmly but
decidedly shook his head in denial, she understood that it was over.
She panted for breath, half-swooning, her kabaai still open, her hair
still unbound.</p>
<p>At that moment L&eacute;onie entered the room. She had seen the
drama enacted before her eyes and felt a thrill of artistic emotion.
She experienced something like compassion in her barren soul. She
approached the princess, who flung herself into her arms, woman seeking
woman in the unreasoning despair of that inevitable doom. And
L&eacute;onie, turning her beautiful eyes on Van Oudijck, murmured a
single word of intercession and whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give in! Give in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And for the second time Van Oudijck wavered. Never had he refused
his wife anything, however costly, for which she asked. But this meant
the sacrifice of his principle never to reconsider a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>decision, always to persist in what he had
resolved should happen. Then had he always controlled the future. Thus
things always happened as he willed. Then had he never shown any
weakness. And he answered that it was impossible.</p>
<p>In his obstinacy, he did not divine the sacred moments in which a
man must not insist upon his own will, but must piously surrender to
the pressure of the hidden forces. These moments he did not respect,
acknowledge or recognize; no, never. He was a man with a clear,
logically deduced, simple, masculine sense of duty, a man of a plain
and simple life. He would never know that, lurking under the simple
life, are all those forces which together make the omnipotent hidden
force. He would have laughed at the idea that there are nations which
have a greater control over that force than the western nations have.
He would shrug his shoulders&mdash;and continue his own road&mdash;at
the mere supposition that among the nations there are a few individuals
in whose hands that force loses its omnipotence and becomes an
instrument. No experience would teach him. He would perhaps for an
instant be nonplussed. But immediately afterwards he would grasp the
chain of his logic in his virile hand and link up the iron actualities
together&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>He saw L&eacute;onie lead the old princess from his office, bowed
and sobbing.</p>
<p>A deep emotion, an utterly agitating compassion, brought the tears
to his eyes. And before those tearful eyes rose the vision of that
Javanese whom he loved like a father.</p>
<p>But he did not give in. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">Reports arrived from Ternate and Halmaheira
that a terrible submarine earthquake had visited the surrounding group
of islands, that whole villages had been washed away, that thousands of
inhabitants had been rendered homeless. The telegrams caused greater
consternation in Holland than in India, where people seemed more used
to the convulsions of the sea, to the volcanic upheavals of the earth.
They had been discussing the Dreyfus case for months, they were
beginning to discuss the Transvaal, but Ternate was hardly mentioned.
Nevertheless a central committee was formed at Batavia; and Van Oudijck
called a meeting. It was resolved to hold a charity-bazaar, at the
earliest possible date, in the club and the garden attached to it. Mrs.
van Oudijck, as usual, delegated everything to Eva Eldersma and did not
trouble herself at all.</p>
<p>For a fortnight Labuwangi was filled with excitement. In this silent
little town, full of eastern slumber, a whirlwind of tiny passions,
jealousies and enmities began to rise. Eva had her club of faithful
adherents, the Van Helderens, the Doorn de Bruijns, the Rantzows, with
which all sorts of tiny sets strove to compete. One was not on speaking
terms with the other; this one would not take part because that one
did; another insisted on taking part only because Mrs. Eldersma
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>must not think that she was everybody; and this
one and that one and the other considered that Eva was much too
pretentious and need not fancy that she was the most important woman in
the place because Mrs. van Oudijck left everything to her. Eva however
had spoken to the resident and declared that she was willing to
organize everything provided she received unlimited authority. She had
not the slightest objection to his appointing some one else to set the
ball rolling; but, if he appointed her, unlimited authority was an
express condition, for to take twenty different tastes and opinions
into account would mean that one would never get anywhere. Van Oudijck
laughingly consented, but impressed upon her that she must not make
people angry and that she must respect every one&rsquo;s feelings and
be as conciliatory as possible, so that the charity-bazaar might leave
pleasant memories behind it. Eva promised: she was not naturally
quarrelsome.</p>
<p>To get a thing done, to set a thing going, to put a thing through,
to employ her artistic energies was her great delight: it was life to
her, was the only consolation in her dreary life in India. For, though
she had grown to love and admire many things in Java, the social life
of the country, save for her little clique, lacked all charm for her.
But now to prepare an entertainment on a large scale, the fame of which
would reach as far as Surabaya, flattered alike her vanity and her love
of work.</p>
<p>She sailed through every difficulty; and, because people saw that
she knew best and was more practical than they, they gave way to her.
But, while she was busy evolving her stalls and her <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span><i lang="fr">tableaux-vivants</i>, while the
bustle of the preparations occupied the leading families of Labuwangi,
something seemed also to occupy the soul of the native population, but
something less cheerful than charitable entertainment. The chief of
police, who brought Van Oudijck his short report every morning, usually
in a few words&mdash;that he had gone his rounds and that everything
was quiet and orderly&mdash;had of late had longer conversations with
the resident, seemed to have more important things to communicate; the
messengers whispered more mysteriously outside the office, the resident
sent for Eldersma and Van Helderen; the secretary wrote to Ngadjiwa, to
Vermalen the assistant-resident, to the major-commandant of the
garrison; and the district controller went round the town with
increased frequency and at unaccustomed hours. Amid all their fussing
the ladies perceived little of these mysterious doings; and only
L&eacute;onie, who took no part in the preparations, noticed in her
husband an unusual silent concern. She was a quick and keen observer;
and, because Van Oudijck, who was accustomed often to mention business
in the domestic circle, had been mute for the last few days, she asked
suddenly where the Regent of Ngadjiwa was, now that he had been
dismissed by the government at Van Oudijck&rsquo;s instance, and who
was going to replace him. He made a vague reply; and she took alarm and
became anxious. One morning, passing through her husband&rsquo;s
bedroom, she was struck by the whispered conversation between Van
Oudijck and the chief of police and she stopped to listen, with her ear
against <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>the screen. The conversation was muffled because
the garden-doors were open; the messengers were sitting on the
garden-steps; a couple of gentlemen who wished to speak to the resident
were walking up and down the side-verandah, after writing their names
on the slate which the chief messenger brought in to the resident. But
they had to wait, because the resident was engaged with the chief of
police&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>L&eacute;onie listened from behind the screen. And she turned pale
at the sound of a word or two which she overheard. She returned
silently to her room, feeling anxious. At lunch she asked if it would
be really necessary for her to attend the fancy-fair, for she had had
such a toothache lately and wanted to go to Surabaya, to the dentist.
It would probably mean a few days: she had not been to the dentist for
ever so long. But Van Oudijck, sterner than usual, in his sombre mood
of secret concern and silence, told her that it was impossible, that on
an evening like that of the fancy-fair she was bound to be present as
the resident&rsquo;s wife. She pouted and sulked and held her
handkerchief to her mouth, so that Van Oudijck became distressed. That
afternoon she did not sleep, did not read, did not dream, as a result
of this unusual agitation. She was frightened, she wanted to get away.
And at tea, in the garden, she began to cry, said that the toothache
was making her head ache, that it was making her quite ill, that it was
more than she could bear. Van Oudijck, distressed and careworn, was
touched; he could never endure to see her tears. And he gave in, as he
always did to her, where her personal <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb178" href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>affairs were in
question. Next day she went off to Surabaya, staying at the
resident&rsquo;s and really having her teeth attended to.</p>
<p>It was always a good thing to do, once a year or so. This time she
spent about five hundred guilders on the dentist. After this,
incidentally, the other ladies also seemed to guess something of what
was happening at Labuwangi behind a haze of mystery. For Ida van
Helderen, the tragic white half-caste, her eyes starting out of her
head with fright, told Eva Eldersma that her husband and Eldersma and
the resident too were fearing a rebellion of the population, incited by
the regent and his family, who would never forgive the dismissal of the
Regent of Ngadjiwa. The men, however, were non-committal and reassured
their wives. But a dark swirling tide continued to stir under the
apparent calmness of their little up-country life. And gradually the
gossip leaked out and alarmed the European inhabitants. Vague
paragraphs in the newspapers, commenting on the dismissal of the
regent, contributed to their alarm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the bustle of preparation for the fancy-fair went on, but
people no longer put their hearts into the work. They led a fussy,
restless life and were becoming ill and nervous. At night they bolted
and barred their houses, placed arms by their bed-sides, woke suddenly
in terror, listening to the noises of the night, which sounded faintly
in space outside. And they condemned the hastiness shown by Van
Oudijck, who, after the scene at the race-ball, had been unable to
restrain his patience any longer and had not hesitated to recommend the
dismissal of the regent, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href=
"#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>whose house was firmly rooted in
the soil of Labuwangi, was one with Labuwangi.</p>
<p>The resident had ordered, as a festival for the population, an
evening market on the square outside the regent&rsquo;s palace, to last
for a few days, coinciding with the bazaar. There would be a
people&rsquo;s fair, numbers of little stalls and booths and a Malay
theatre, with plays drawn from the Arabian Nights. He had done this in
order to give the Javanese inhabitants a treat which they would value
greatly, while the Europeans were enjoying themselves on their side. It
was now a few days before the fancy-fair, on the previous day to which,
as it chanced, the monthly council was to be held in the palace.</p>
<p>The anxiety, the fuss and a general nervousness filled the otherwise
quiet little town with an emotion which made people almost ill. Mothers
sent their children away and themselves were undecided what to do. But
the fancy-fair made people stay. How could they avoid going to the
fancy-fair? There was so seldom any amusement. But &hellip; if there
really were a rising! And they did not know what to do, whether to take
the lowering menace, which they half-divined, seriously or make a
light-hearted jest of it.</p>
<p>The day before the council, Van Oudijck asked for an interview with
the raden-aju pang&eacute;ran, who lived with her son. His carriage
drove past the huts and booths in the square and through the triumphal
arches of the market, formed of bamboo-stems bending towards each
other, with a narrow strip of bunting rippling in the wind, so much so
that, in Javanese, the decorations are <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>known as
&ldquo;ripplings.&rdquo; This evening was to be the first evening of
the fair. Every one was busy with the final preparations; and, in the
bustle of hammering and arranging, the natives sometimes neglected to
cower at the passing of the resident&rsquo;s carriage and paid no
attention to the golden umbrella which the messenger on the box held in
his hands like a furled sun. But, when the carriage turned by the
flagstaff and up the drive leading to the palace and they saw that the
resident was going to the regent&rsquo;s, groups huddled together and
spoke in eager whispers. They crowded at the <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2345" title="Source: entrace">entrance</span> to the drive and
stared. But the natives saw nothing save the empty market-place looming
beyond the shadow of the banyans, with the rows of chairs in readiness.
The chief of police, suddenly passing on his bicycle, caused the groups
to break up as though by instinct.</p>
<p>The old princess was awaiting the resident in the front-verandah.
Her dignified features wore a serene expression and betrayed no trace
of what was raging within her. She motioned the resident to a chair;
and the conversation opened with a few ordinary phrases. Then four
servants approached in a crouching posture: one with a bottle-stand;
the second with a tray full of glasses; the third with a silver
ice-pail full of broken ice; the fourth salaamed, without carrying
anything. The princess asked the resident what he would drink; and he
replied that he would like a whisky-and-soda. The fourth servant came
crouching through the other three to prepare the drink, poured in the
measure of whisky, opened the bottle of soda-water with a report as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>of a gun and dropped into the tumbler a lump of
ice the size of a small glacier. Not another word was said. The
resident waited for the drink to grow cold; and the four servants
crouched away. Then at last Van Oudijck spoke and asked if he might
speak to her in entire confidence, if he could say what he had in his
mind. She begged him, civilly, to do so. And in his firm but hushed
voice he told her, in Malay, in very courteous sentences, full of
friendliness and flowery politeness, how great and exalted his love had
been for the pang&eacute;ran and still was for that prince&rsquo;s
glorious house, although he, Van Oudijck, to his intense regret, had
been obliged to act counter to that love, because his duty commanded
him so to act. And he asked her&mdash;presuming that it was possible
for her, as a mother&mdash;to bear him no grudge for this exercise of
his duty; he asked her, on the contrary, to show a motherly feeling for
him, the European official, who had loved the pang&eacute;ran as a
father, and to cooperate with him, the official&mdash;she, the mother
of the regent&mdash;by employing her great influence for the happiness
and welfare of the population. Sunario had a tendency, in his piety and
his remote gaze at things invisible, to forget the actual realities
that lay before his eyes. Well, he, the resident, was asking her, the
powerful, influential mother, to cooperate with him in ways which
Sunario overlooked, to cooperate with him in love and unity. And, in
his elegant Malay, he opened his heart to her entirely, describing the
turmoil which for days and days had been seething among the
inhabitants, like an evil poison which could not do other than make
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>them wicked and drunk and would probably lead to
things, to acts, which were bound to have lamentable results. He made
her feel his unspoken view that the government would be the stronger,
that a terrible punishment would overtake all who should prove guilty,
high and low alike. But his language remained exceedingly cautious and
his speech respectful, as of a son addressing a mother. She, though she
understood him, valued the tactful grace of his manner; and the flowery
depth and earnestness of his language made him rise in her esteem and
almost surprised her &hellip; in a low Hollander, without birth or
breeding. But he continued. He did not tell her what he knew, that she
was the instigatress of this obscure unrest; but he excused that
unrest, said that he understood it, that the population shared her
grief in respect of her unworthy son, himself a scion of the noble
race, and that it was only natural that the people should sympathize
deeply with their old soveran, even though the sympathy was ignorant
and illogical. For the son <i>was</i> unworthy, the Regent of Ngadjiwa
had proved himself unworthy and what had happened could not have
happened otherwise.</p>
<p>His voice, for a moment, became severe; and she bowed her grey head,
remained silent, seemed to agree. But his words now became gentler
again; and once more he asked for her cooperation, asked her to use her
influence for the best. He trusted her entirely. He knew that she held
high the traditions of her family, loyalty to the Company,
unimpeachable loyalty to the government. Well, he asked her to direct
her power <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>and influence, to use the love and reverence
which the people bore her in such a way that she, in concert with him,
would allay what was seething in the darkness; that she would move the
thoughtless to reflection; that she would assuage and pacify what was
secretly threatening, thoughtlessly and frivolously, against the firm
and dignified authority of the government. And, while he flattered and
threatened her in one breath, he felt that she&mdash;although she
hardly spoke a single word and merely punctuated his words with her
repeated <i>saja</i>&mdash;he felt that she was falling under his
stronger influence, the influence of the man of tact and authority, and
that he was giving her food for reflection. He felt that, as she
reflected, her hatred was subsiding, her vindictiveness losing its
force and that he was breaking the energy and pride of the ancient
blood of the Maduran sultans. Under all the flowers of his speech, he
allowed her to catch a glimpse of utter ruin, of terrible penalties, of
the undeniably greater power of the government. And he bent her to the
old pliant attitude of yielding before the might of the ruler. He
reminded her, in her impulse to rebel and throw off the hated yoke,
that it was better to be calm and reasonable and to adapt herself
placidly to things as they were. She nodded her head softly in assent;
and he felt that he had conquered her. And this aroused a certain pride
within him.</p>
<p>And now she also spoke and gave the required promise, saying, in her
broken, inwardly weeping voice, that she loved him as a son, that she
would do what he wished and would assuredly use her influence, outside
the palace, in the town, to still <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184"
href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>these threatening troubles.
She denied her own complicity and said that the unrest arose from the
unreflecting love of the people, who suffered with her, because of her
son. She now echoed his own words, save that she did not speak of
unworthiness. For she was a mother. And she repeated once again that he
could trust her, that she would act according to his wish. Then he
informed her that he would come to the council next day, with his
subordinates and with the native head-men; and he said that he trusted
her so completely that all of them, the Europeans, would be unarmed. He
looked her in the eyes. He threatened her more by saying this than if
he had spoken of arms. For he was threatening her&mdash;without a
threatening word, merely by the intonation of his Malay
speech&mdash;with the punishment, with the vengeance of the government,
if a hair was injured of the least of its officials.</p>
<p>He had risen from his seat. She also rose, wrung her hands,
entreated him not to speak like that, entreated him to have the fullest
confidence in her and in her son. She sent for Sunario. The Regent of
Labuwangi entered; and Van Oudijck again repeated that he hoped for
peace and reason. And he felt, by the tone of the old princess in
speaking to her son, that she wished for peace and reason. He felt that
she, the mother, was omnipotent in the palace.</p>
<p>The regent bowed his head, agreed, promised, even said that he had
already taken pacifying measures, that he had always regretted this
excitement of the populace, that it grieved him greatly, now that the
resident had noticed it, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href=
"#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>in spite of his, Sunario&rsquo;s,
attempts at pacification. The resident did not go further into this
insincerity. He knew that the discontent was fanned from the Kabupaten,
but he knew also that he had won. Once more, however, he impressed upon
the regent his responsibility, if anything happened in the
market-place, next day, during the council. The regent entreated him
not to think of such a thing. And now, to part on friendly terms, he
begged Van Oudijck to sit down again. Van Oudijck resumed his seat. In
so doing, he knocked as though by accident against the tumbler, all
frosted with the chill of the ice, which he had not yet put to his
lips. It fell clattering to the ground. He apologized for his
clumsiness. The raden-aju pang&eacute;ran had remarked his movement and
her old face turned pale. She said nothing, but beckoned to an
attendant. And the four servants appeared again, crouching along the
floor, and mixed a second whisky-and-soda. Van Oudijck at once lifted
the glass to his lips.</p>
<p>There was a painful silence. To what degree the resident&rsquo;s
movement in upsetting the glass was justified would always remain a
problem. He would never know. But he wished to show the princess that,
when coming here, he was prepared for anything, <i>before</i> their
conversation, and that, <i>after</i> this conversation, he meant to
trust her utterly and completely, not only in respect of the drink
which she offered him, but next day, at the council, where he and his
officials would <span class="corr" id="xd26e2383" title=
"Source: apppear">appear</span> unarmed, and in respect of her
influence for good, which would bring peace and tranquillity to the
people. And, as though to show <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186"
href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>him that she understood him
and that his confidence would be wholly justified, she rose and
whispered a few words to an attendant whom she had beckoned to her. The
Javanese disappeared and soon returned, crouching all the way through
the front-verandah and carrying a long object in a yellow case. The
princess took it from him and handed it to Sunario, who took a
walking-stick from the yellow silk case and offered it to the resident
as a token of their fraternal friendship. Van Oudijck accepted it,
understanding the symbol. For the yellow silk case was of the colour
and the material of authority, yellow or gold and silk; the stick was
of a wood that serves as a protection against snake-bites and ill-luck;
and the heavy knob was wrought of the metal of authority, gold, in the
form of the ancient sultan&rsquo;s crown. This stick, offered at such a
moment, signified that the Adiningrats submitted anew and that Van
Oudijck could trust them.</p>
<p>And, when he took his leave, he felt very proud and esteemed himself
highly. For by exercising tact, diplomacy and knowledge of the Javanese
he had won; he would have allayed the rebellion merely by words. That
would be a fact.</p>
<p>That was so, that would be so: a fact. On that first evening of the
public fair, lighted gaily with a hundred paraffin-lamps, scented
alluringly with the trailing odours of cooking food, full of the motley
whirl of the holiday-making populace, that first evening was wholly
given up to rejoicing; and the people discussed with one another the
long and friendly visit which the resident had paid to the regent and
his mother; for they had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href=
"#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>seen the carriage with the
umbrella waiting a long time in the drive and the regent&rsquo;s
attendants had told of the present of the walking-stick.</p>
<p>That was so: the fact existed and had happened as Van Oudijck had
planned it in advance and compelled it to happen. And that he should be
proud of this was human. But what he had not compelled or planned in
advance was the hidden forces, which he never divined, whose existence
he would deny, always, in his simple, natural life. What he did
<i>not</i> see and hear and feel was the very hidden force, which had
indeed subsided, but was yet smouldering, like a volcanic fire, under
the apparently peaceful meadows of flowers and amity and peace; the
hatred which would possess a power of impenetrable mystery, against
which he, the European, was unarmed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first dropcap">Van Oudijck was fond of certain effects. He
did not say much about his visit to the palace that day, nor in the
evening, when Eldersma and Van Helderen came to speak to him about the
council which would be held next morning. They felt more or less uneasy
and asked if they should go armed. But Van Oudijck very firmly and
decidedly forbade them to take arms with them and said that no one was
allowed to do so. The officials gave way, but nobody felt comfortable.
The council, however, took place in complete peace and harmony; only,
there were more people moving about among the booths in the
market-place, there were more police at the ornamental arches, with the
rippling strips of bunting. But nothing happened. The wives indoors
were anxious and felt relieved when their husbands were safely back
home again. And Van Oudijck had obtained his effect. He now paid a few
visits, feeling sure of his grip on things, relying on the raden-aju
<span class="corr" id="xd26e2405" title=
"Source: pangeran">pang&eacute;ran</span>. He reassured the ladies and
told them to think of nothing now except the fancy-fair. But they were
none too confident. Some families, in the evening, bolted all their
doors and remained in the middle gallery with their visitors and
children and babus, armed, listening, on their guard.</p>
<p>Theo, to whom his father had spoken in an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>outburst of confidence, planned and played a
practical joke with Addie. The two lads, one evening, went round the
houses of those whom he knew to be most fidgety and made their way into
the front-verandah and shouted to have the doors opened; and they could
hear the cocking of fire-arms in the middle galleries. They had a merry
evening of it.</p>
<p>Then at last the fancy-fair took place. Eva had organized a series
of three <i>tableaux</i> from the Arthurian legend on the stage of the
club: Vivien and Guinevere and Lancelot; in the middle of the garden
was a Madura proa, fitted up like a Viking&rsquo;s ship, in which iced
punch was served; a neighbouring sugar-factory, always full of fun,
famed for its jovial tone, had provided a complete Dutch
fritters-stall, as a nostalgic memory of Holland, with the ladies
dressed as Frisian peasant-girls and the young fellows from the factory
as cooks; and the excitement over the Transvaal was represented by a
Majuba Hill with ladies and gentlemen in fantastic Boer costumes. There
was not a word about the tremendous seaquake at Ternate, although one
half of the receipts was destined for the devastated districts. Under
the glowing festoons of Chinese lanterns slung across the gardens, a
great sense of fun prevailed, coupled with a readiness to spend pots of
money, especially on behalf of the Transvaal. But amid the merriment
there yet quivered a fear. Groups assembled, peering glances were cast
at the road outside, where Eurasians, Javanese, Chinese and Arabs stood
round the steaming portable kitchens. And the visitors, while tossing
off a glass of champagne <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href=
"#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>or toying with a plate of
fritters, turned their ears in the direction of the square, where the
public fair was in full swing. When Van Oudijck appeared with Doddie,
received with the national anthem, generously scattering rixdollars and
banknotes, he was constantly asked whispered questions. And, when it
was seen that Mrs. van Oudijck was not coming, people began to ask one
another where she was. She had been suffering so with her teeth, said
one; she had gone to Surabaya to see the dentist. They did not think it
nice of her; they did not like her when they did not see her. She was
much discussed that evening; the most horrible scandals were told about
her. Doddie took up her stand in the Madura proa as a saleswoman; and
Van Oudijck, with Eldersma, Van Helderen and a couple of controllers
from other districts, went round and treated the members of his
council. When people asked their mysterious questions, with anxious
glances at the road, with ears pricked towards the popular market, he
reassured them with a majestic smile; nothing was going to happen, he
pledged his word on it. They considered him extremely trusting,
mightily sure of himself; but the jovial smile around his thick
moustache was comforting. He urged all who belonged to his good town of
Labuwangi to think of nothing but enjoyment and benevolence. And, when
suddenly the Regent, Raden Adipati Sunario, and his wife, the young
raden-aju, appeared at the entrance and paid for bouquets, programmes
and fans with a hundred-guilder-note, the tension was relaxed
throughout the garden. Everybody soon knew <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>about the hundred-guilder-note. And they all
breathed again, realizing that there was now no occasion for anxiety,
that there would be no insurrection that night. They made much of the
regent and his smiling young wife, who glittered with her beautiful
jewels.</p>
<p>Out of sheer relief and relaxation of their tense anxiety, out of
sheer craziness, they spent more and more money, trying to vie with the
few wealthy Chinese&mdash;those dating from before the opium-monopoly,
the owners of the white marble and stucco palaces&mdash;as these with
their wives, in embroidered grey and green Chinese costumes, their
shiny hair stuck full of flowers and precious stones, smelling strongly
of sandalwood, distributed rixdollars broadcast. Money flowed like
water, dripped as though in silver drops into the collecting-boxes of
the delighted saleswomen. And the fancy-fair was a success. And, when
Van Oudijck at last, little by little, here and there, said a word to
Doorn de Bruijn, to Rantzow, to the officials from other residencies
about his visit, about his interview with the raden-aju <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e2423" title=
"Source: pangeran">pang&eacute;ran</span>&mdash;assuming an air of
humility and simplicity, but nevertheless, despite himself, beaming
with happy pride, with delight in his triumph&mdash;then he attained
his greatest effect.</p>
<p>The story ran round the garden, of the tact, the cleverness of the
resident, who had laid the spectre of insurrection merely with a word.
He received a sort of ovation. And he filled every glass with
champagne, he bought up every fan, he purchased all the tickets in the
tombola that remained unsold. It was his apotheosis, his greatest
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>moment of success and popularity. And he joked
with the ladies and flirted with them.</p>
<p>The entertainment was prolonged until daylight, until six
o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The merry cooks were drunk and danced
around their fritters-stove. And, when Van Oudijck went home at last,
he felt an inner mood of self-satisfaction, of strength, he was
delighted, enraptured with himself. He felt a king in his little world
and a diplomatist into the bargain and beloved by all whose quiet and
peace he had assured. That evening made him rise in his own esteem and
he valued himself more highly than he had ever done before. Never had
he felt as happy as he felt now.</p>
<p>He had sent the carriage away and he walked home with Doddie. A few
early salesmen were going to market. Doddie, dog-tired and half-asleep,
dragged herself along on her father&rsquo;s arm &hellip; until some one
passed close beside her and, feeling rather than seeing, she suddenly
shuddered. She looked up. The figure had passed. She looked round and
recognized the back of the hadji, hurrying away&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>She turned cold and felt as though she would faint. But then,
wearily, walking in her sleep, she reflected that she was half
dreaming, dreaming of Addie, of Patjaram, of the moonlit night under
the tjemaras, where the white hadji had startled her at the end of the
avenue&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">Eva Eldersma was in a more listless and
dejected mood than she had yet experienced in Java. After her efforts,
after the fuss and the success of the fancy-fair, after the shuddering
fear of a rising, the little town conscientiously went to sleep again,
as though well content to be able to slumber as usual. It was December
and the heavy rains had begun, as usual, on the fifth of the month: the
rainy monsoon invariably opened on St. Nicholas&rsquo; Day. The clouds
which, for the past month, continually swelling, had piled themselves
upon the lower horizons now rose curtain-wise, like water-laden sails
higher against the skies, rent open as by a sudden fury of far-flashing
lightning, pouring and lashing down as though this wealth of water
could no longer be upheld, now that the swollen sails were torn apart,
as though all their wanton abundance came streaming down from a single
rent. Of an evening, Eva&rsquo;s front-verandah was invaded by a crazy
swarm of insects, which, drunk with light, rushed upon their
destruction in the lamps, as in an apotheosis of fiery death, filling
the lamp-chimneys and strewing the marble tables with their fluttering,
dying bodies. Eva inhaled a cooler air, but a miasma of damp, arising
from earth and leaves, soaked the walls, seemed to ooze from the
furniture, dimming the mirrors, staining the silk hangings <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>and
covering boots and shoes with mildew, as though nature&rsquo;s frenzied
downpour were bent on the ruin of all that was fine and delicate,
sparkling and graceful in human achievement. But the trees and foliage
and grass shot up and expanded and rioted luxuriantly upwards, in a
thousand shades of fresh green; and, in the reviving glory of verdant
nature, the crouching human community of open-fronted villas, wet and
humid with fungi, all the whiteness of the lime-washed pillars and
flower-pots turned to a mouldy green.</p>
<p>Eva watched the slow and gradual ruin of her house, her furniture,
her clothes. Day by day, inexorably, something was spoilt, something
rotted away, something was covered with mildew or rust. And none of the
&aelig;sthetic philosophy with which she had at first taught herself to
love India, to appreciate the good in India, to seek in India for
external plastic beauty and inward beauty of soul, was able to
withstand the streaming water, the cracking of her furniture, the
staining of her frocks and gloves, the damp, mildew and rust that
wrecked the exquisite environment which she had designed and created
all around her, as a comfort, to console her for living in India. All
her logic, all her feeling of making the best of things, of finding
something attractive and beautiful after all in the land of
all-prevailing nature and of people eager for money and position, all
this failed her and came to naught, now that she was every moment
irritated and incensed as a housewife, as an elegant woman, an artistic
woman. No, it was impossible in India to surround one&rsquo;s self
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>with taste and exquisiteness. She had been here
for only two years and she was still able to make a certain fight for
her western culture; but nevertheless she was now already better able
than in the first days after her arrival to understand the <i lang=
"fr">laisser-aller</i> of the men, after their hard work, and of the
women, in their housekeeping. True, the servants with their soundless
movements, working with gentle hands, willing, never impertinent, were
to her thinking far superior to the noisy, pounding maids in Holland;
but nevertheless she felt in all her household an eastern antagonism to
her western ideas. It was always a struggle not to surrender to that
<i lang="fr">laisser-aller</i>, to the running to waste of the
over-large grounds, invariably hung at the back with the dirty washing
of the servants and strewn with nibbled mangoes; to the gradual
spoiling and fading of the paint of the house, which was also too
large, too open, too much exposed to wind and weather to be cared for
with Dutch cleanliness; to the habit of sitting and rocking, undressed,
in sarong and kabaai, with one&rsquo;s bare feet in slippers, because
it was really too hot, too sultry to dress one&rsquo;s self in a frock
or tea-gown, which only became soaked in perspiration. It was for her
sake that her husband always dressed for dinner, in a black jacket and
stand-up collar; but, when she saw his tired face, with that more and
more fixed, overtired office expression above that stand-up collar, she
herself begged him not to trouble to dress next time after his second
bath and allowed him to dine in a white jacket, or even in pyjamas. She
thought it terrible, thought it unspeakably <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>dreadful; it shocked all her ideas of
correctness; but really he was too tired and it was too sultry and
oppressive for her to expect anything more from him. And she, after
only two years in India, understood more and more easily that <i lang=
"fr">laisser-aller</i>&mdash;in dress, in body and in soul&mdash;now
that every day she lost something more of her fresh, Dutch blood and
her western energy, now that she admitted, certainly, that in India men
worked perhaps as in no other country, but that they worked with one
sole object before their eyes: position, money, retirement, pension
&hellip; and home, back home to Europe. True, there were others, born
in India, who had been out of India only once, for barely a year, who
would not hear of Holland, who adored their land of sunshine. She knew
that the De Luces were like this; and there were others as well, she
knew. But in her own circle of civil servants and planters every one
had the same object in life: position, money &hellip; and then off, off
to Europe. Every one calculated the years of work still before him.
Every one saw before him in the future the illusion of that European
retirement. An occasional friend, like Van Oudijck, an occasional civil
servant, who perhaps loved his work for his work&rsquo;s sake and
because it suited his nature, feared the coming pensioned retirement,
which would mean a stupid, vegetating existence. But Van Oudijck was an
exception. The majority worked in the service and on the plantations
for the sake of the rest to come. Her husband also, for instance, was
toiling like a slave to become assistant-resident and, after some
years, to draw his pension; he slaved and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>toiled for his
illusion of rest. At present she felt her own energy leaving her with
every drop of blood that she felt flowing more sluggishly through her
weary veins. And, in these early days of the wet monsoon, while the
eaves of the house incessantly discharged the thick, plashing shafts
which irritated her with their clatter, while she watched the gradual
ruin of all the material surroundings which she had selected with so
much taste as her artistic consolation in India, she reached a more
discordant mood of listlessness and dejection than she had ever gone
through before. Her child was still too small to mean much to her, to
be a kindred spirit. Her husband did nothing but work. He was a kind
and thoughtful husband to her, a dear fellow in every way, a man of
great simplicity, whom she had accepted&mdash;perhaps only because of
this simplicity, because of the quiet serenity of his smiling,
fair-skinned, Frisian face and the burliness of his broad
shoulders&mdash;after one or two excited, juvenile romances of
enthusiasm and misunderstanding and soulful discussions, romances
dating from her girlhood. She, who was herself neither simple nor
serene, had sought the simplicity of her life in a simple romance. But
his qualities failed to satisfy her. Now especially, when she had been
longer in India and was suffering defeat in her contest with the
country that did not harmonize with her nature, his serene conjugal
love failed to satisfy her.</p>
<p>She was beginning to feel unhappy. She was too versatile a woman to
find all her happiness in her little boy. He certainly filled a part of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>her life, with the minor cares of the present
and the thought of his future. She had even worked out a whole
educational system for him. But he did not fill her life entirely. And
a longing for Holland encompassed her, a longing for her parents, a
longing for the beautiful, artistic home where you were always meeting
painters, writers, musicians, the artistic <i>salon</i>&mdash;an
exception in Holland&mdash;that gathered together for a brief moment
the artistic elements which in Holland usually remained isolated.</p>
<p>The vision passed before her eyes like a vague and distant dream,
while she listened to the approaching thunders that filled the air,
sultry to bursting-point, while she gazed at the downpour that
followed. Here she had nothing. Here she felt out of place. Here she
had her little clique of adherents, who collected around her because
she was cheerful; but she found no sort of deeper sympathy, no serious
conversation &hellip; except in Van Helderen. And with him she meant to
be careful, so as to give him no illusions.</p>
<p>There was only Van Helderen. And she thought of all the other people
around her at Labuwangi. She thought of people, people everywhere. And,
very pessimistic in these days, she found in all of them the same
egoism, the same self-complacency, the same unattractiveness, the same
self-absorption: she could hardly express it to herself, distracted as
she was by the terrific force of the pelting rain. But she found in
everybody conscious and unconscious traits of unloveliness &hellip;
even in her faithful adherents &hellip; and in her husband &hellip; and
in the men, young wives, girls, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199"
href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>young men around her. There
was nothing in any of them but his own ego. Not one of them had
sufficient harmony of mind for himself and another. She disapproved of
this in one, hated that in another; a third and a fourth she condemned
entirely. This critical attitude made her despondent and melancholy,
for it was against her nature: she preferred to like others. She liked
to live, in spontaneous harmony, with a number of associates:
originally she had a profound love of people, a love of humanity. Great
questions moved her. But nothing that she felt met with any echo. She
found herself empty and alone, in a country, a town, an environment in
which all and everything, large and small, offended her soul, her body,
her character, her nature. Her husband worked. Her child was already
becoming thoroughly Indian. Her piano was out of tune.</p>
<p>She stood up and tried the piano, with long scales that ended in the
<i lang="de">Feuerzauber</i> of <i>Valkyrie</i>. But the roar of the
rain was louder than her playing. When she got up again, feeling
desperately dejected, she saw Van Helderen standing before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You startled me,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I stay to lunch?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I am all by
myself at home. Ida has gone to Tosari for her malaria and has taken
the children with her. She went yesterday. It&rsquo;s an expensive
business. How I&rsquo;m to keep going this month I do not
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send the children to us, after they&rsquo;ve had a few days
in the hills.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200"
name="pb200">200</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they bother you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. I&rsquo;ll write to Ida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really awfully good of you. It would certainly
make things easier for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you well?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel deadly,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I were dying by inches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible here. We&rsquo;ve been longing for the
rains; and, now that they&rsquo;ve come, they are driving me mad. And
&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what: I can&rsquo;t stand it here any
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In India. I have taught myself to see the good, the beautiful
in this country. It&rsquo;s all no use. I can&rsquo;t go on with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to Holland,&rdquo; he said gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My people would be glad to see me, no doubt. It would be good
for my boy, because he&rsquo;s forgetting his Dutch daily, though I had
begun to teach it to him so conscientiously, and he speaks Malay
&hellip; or gibberish. But I can&rsquo;t leave my husband here all
alone. He would have nothing here without me. At least, I think so:
that is one more sort of illusion. Perhaps it&rsquo;s not so at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, if you fall ill&#8202;&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her whole being was filled with an unusual fatigue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re exaggerating!&rdquo; he began,
cheerfully. &ldquo;Come, perhaps you&rsquo;re exaggerating!
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>What&rsquo;s upsetting you, what&rsquo;s making
you so unhappy? Let&rsquo;s draw up an inventory together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An inventory of my misfortunes? Very well. My garden is a
marsh. Three chairs in my front-verandah are splitting to pieces. The
white ants have devoured my beautiful Japanese mats. A new silk frock
has come out all over stains, for no reason that I can make out.
Another is all unravelled, simply with the heat, I believe. To say
nothing of various minor miseries of the same order. To console myself
I took refuge in the <i lang="de">Feuerzauber</i>. My piano was out of
tune; I believe there are cockroaches walking among the
strings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave a little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re idiots here,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;we
Europeans in this country! Why do we bring all the paraphernalia of our
costly civilization with us, considering that it&rsquo;s bound not to
last? Why don&rsquo;t we live in a cool bamboo hut, sleep on a mat,
dress in a cotton sarong and a chintz kabaai, with a scarf over our
shoulders and a flower in our hair. All your civilization by which you
propose to grow rich &hellip; is a western idea, which fails in the
long run. Our whole administration &hellip; is so tiring in the heat.
Why&mdash;if we must be here&mdash;don&rsquo;t we live simply and plant
paddy and live on nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking like a woman,&rdquo; he said, with
another little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Perhaps I don&rsquo;t mean
quite all I say. But that I feel here, opposing me, opposing all my
western notions, a force which is antagonistic to me &hellip; that is
certain. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>I am sometimes frightened. I always feel
&hellip; that I am on the point of being conquered, I don&rsquo;t know
what by: by something out of the ground, by a force of nature, by a
secret in the soul of these black people, whom I don&rsquo;t
know&#8202;&hellip;. I feel particularly afraid at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re overwrought,&rdquo; he said, tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; she replied, wearily, seeing that he did not
understand and too tired to go on explaining. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk
about something else. That table-turning&rsquo;s very
curious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other day, the three of us: Ida, you and
I&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was certainly very curious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the first time? Addie de Luce: it seems to be
true about him and Mrs. van Oudijck&#8202;&hellip;. And the
insurrection &hellip; the table foretold it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we not have suggested it unconsciously?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But to think that we should all be
playing fair and that that table should go tapping and talking to us by
means of an alphabet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t do it often, Eva, if I were you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think it inexplicable, and yet it&rsquo;s already
beginning to bore me. One grows so accustomed to the
incomprehensible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s incomprehensible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes &hellip; and everything&rsquo;s a bore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eva!&rdquo; he said, with a soft, reproachful laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give up the fight. I shall just sit in my rocking-chair
&hellip; and look at the rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a time when you used to see the beautiful side of
my country.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203"
name="pb203">203</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Your country? Which you would be glad to leave to-morrow to
go to the Paris Exhibition!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How humble you are to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sad, because of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t be that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play something more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, have your gin-and-bitters. Help yourself. I shall
play on my out-of-tune piano; it will sound as melodious as my soul,
which is also all of a tangle&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went back to the middle gallery and played something from
<i>Parsifal</i>. He remained sitting outside and listened. The rain was
pouring furiously. The garden stood clean and empty. A violent
thunder-clap seemed to split the world asunder. Nature was supreme; and
in her gigantic manifestation the two people in that damp house were
diminished, his love was nothing, her melancholy was nothing and the
mystic music of the Grail was as a child&rsquo;s ditty to the echoing
mystery of that thunder-clap, whereat fate itself seemed to sail with
heavenly cymbals over these doomed creatures in the Deluge.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">Van Helderen&rsquo;s two children, a boy and
girl of six and seven, were staying at Eva&rsquo;s; and Van Helderen
came in regularly once a day for a meal. He no longer spoke of his
intense feeling, as though unwilling to disturb the pleasant intimacy
of their daily intercourse. And she accepted his daily visits, was
powerless to keep him at a distance. He was the only man in her
immediate circle with whom she could speak and think aloud; and he was
a comfort to her in these days of dejection. She did not understand how
she had come to this, but she gradually lapsed into an absolute apathy,
a sort of annihilating condition of thinking nothing necessary. She had
never been like this before. Her nature was lively and cheerful,
seeking and admiring the beautiful in poetry and music and painting,
things which, from her early childhood, from her childish books, she
had seen about her and felt and discussed. In India she had gradually
come to lack everything of which she felt a need. In her despair she
succumbed to a sort of nihilism that made her ask:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the reason of anything?&hellip; Why the world and the
people in it and the mountains?&hellip; Why all this tiny whirl of
life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, when she read of the social movements, of the great social
problems in Europe, of the Eurasian question in Java, which was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>becoming more and more urgent, she thought to
herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should there be a world, if man eternally remains the
same, small and suffering and oppressed by all the misery of his
humanity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not see the purpose of it all. Half of mankind was suffering
poverty and struggling upwards out of that darkness &hellip; to what?
The other half was stagnating stupidly and dully amid its riches.
Between the two was a scale of gradations, from black poverty to dismal
wealth. Over them stood the rainbow of the eternal illusions, love,
art, the great notes of interrogation of justice and peace and an ideal
future&#8202;&hellip;. She felt that it was much ado about nothing, she
failed to see the purpose and she thought of herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it all so?&hellip; And why the world and poor
humanity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had never felt like this before, but there was no struggling
against it. Gradually, from day to day, India was making her so, making
her sick at her very soul. Frans van Helderen was her only consolation.
The young controller, who had never been to Europe, who had received
all his education at Batavia, who had passed his examinations at
Batavia, with his distinguished manners, his supple courtesy, his
strange, enigmatic nationality, had grown dear to her in friendship
because of his almost exotic development. She told him how she
delighted in this friendship; and he no longer replied by offering his
love. There was too much charm about their present relation. There was
something ideal in it, which they both needed. In their everyday
surroundings, that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206"
name="pb206">206</a>]</span>friendship shone before them like an
exquisite halo of which they were both proud. He often called to see
her, especially now that his wife was at Tosari; and they would walk in
the evening twilight to the beacon which stood by the sea like a small
Eiffel tower. These walks were much talked about, but they did not mind
that. They sat down on the foundation of the beacon, looked out to sea
and listened to the distance. Ghostly proas, with sails like
night-birds&rsquo; wings, glided into the canal, to the droning
sing-song of the fishermen. A melancholy of resignation, of a small
world and small people hovered beneath the skies filled with twinkling
stars, where gleamed the mystic diamonds of the Southern Cross or the
Turkish crescent of the horned moon. And above that melancholy of the
droning fishermen, of crazy proas, of small people at the foot of the
little light-house, drifted a fathomless immensity of the skies and the
eternal stars. And from out the immensity drifted the unutterable, as
it were the superhumanly divine, wherein all that was small and human
sank and melted away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why attach any value to life when I may die to-morrow?&rdquo;
thought Eva. &ldquo;Why all this confusion and turmoil of mankind, when
to-morrow perhaps everything may have ceased to exist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she put the question to him. He replied that each of us was not
living for himself and the present age, but for all mankind and for the
future. But she gave a bitter laugh, shrugged her shoulders, thought
him commonplace. And she thought herself commonplace, to think such
things that had so often been thought before. But still, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>notwithstanding her self-criticism, she
continued under the obsession of the uselessness of life, when
everything might be dead to-morrow. And an humiliating littleness, as
of atoms, overcame them, both of them, as they sat gazing into the
spaciousness of the skies and the eternal stars.</p>
<p>Yet they loved those moments, which were everything in their lives;
for, when they did not feel their pettiness too keenly, they spoke of
books, music, painting and the big, important things of life. And they
felt that, in spite of the circulating library and the Italian opera at
Surabaya, they were no longer in touch with the world. They felt the
great, important things to be very far from them. And both of them now
became seized with a nostalgia for Europe, a longing to feel so very
small no longer. They would both have liked to get away, to go to
Europe. But neither of them was able. Their petty, daily life held them
captive. Then, as though spontaneously, in mutual harmony, they spoke
of what was soul and being and all the mystery thereof.</p>
<p>All the mystery. They felt it in the sea, in the sky; but they also
quietly sought it in the rapping leg of a table. They did not
understand how a soul or spirit could reveal itself through a table on
which they earnestly laid their hands and which through their magnetic
fluid was transformed from dead to living matter. But, when they laid
their hands upon it, the table lived and they were forced to believe.
The letters which they counted out were often confused, according to
some strange alphabet; and the table, as though <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>directed by a mocking spirit, constantly showed
a tendency to tease and confuse, to stop suddenly or to be coarse and
indecent. Sometimes they read books on spiritualism and did not know
whether to believe or not.</p>
<p>These were quiet days of quiet monotony in the little town swept by
the rustling rain. Their life in common seemed unreal, like a dream
that rose through the rain like a mist. And it was like a sudden
awakening for Eva when, one afternoon, walking outside in the damp
avenue waiting for Van Helderen, she saw Van Oudijck coming in her
direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just on my way to you!&rdquo; he cried, excitedly.
&ldquo;I was just coming to ask a favour. Will you help me once
more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what, resident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But first tell me: aren&rsquo;t you well? You&rsquo;ve not
been looking very fit lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing serious,&rdquo; she said, with a dreary
laugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll pass. What can I help you in,
resident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something to be done, mevrouwtje, and we
can&rsquo;t manage without you. My wife herself was saying this
morning, &lsquo;Better ask Mrs. Eldersma.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Mrs. Staats, the station-master&rsquo;s widow. The
poor woman has been left without a thing, except her five children and
some debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He committed suicide, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s very sad. And we really must help her.
There&rsquo;s a lot of money needed. Sending <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>round a subscription-list won&rsquo;t bring in
much. People are very generous, but they&rsquo;ve already made such
sacrifices lately. They went mad at the fancy-fair. They can&rsquo;t do
much for the moment, so near the end of the month. But, early next
month, in the first week of January, mevrouwtje, some theatricals by
your Thalia society: you know, nothing elaborate, a couple of
drawing-room sketches and no expenses. Seats at a guilder and a half,
two guilders and a half, perhaps, and, if <i>you</i> set it going, the
hall will be full; people will come over from Surabaya. You must help
me, you will, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, resident,&rdquo; said Eva, wearily, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
just had those <i lang="fr">tableaux-vivants</i>. Don&rsquo;t be angry
with me, but I don&rsquo;t care to be always acting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, you must this time,&rdquo; Van Oudijck insisted, a
little imperiously, greatly excited about his plan.</p>
<p>She became peevish. She liked her independence; and in these days of
dejection particularly she was too disconsolate, in these days of
dreaming she felt too much confused to accede at once with a good grace
to his authoritative request:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, resident, I can think of nothing this time,&rdquo;
she answered, curtly. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t Mrs. van Oudijck do it
herself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was startled when she had made this peevish remark. Walking
beside her, the resident lost his composure; and his face clouded over.
The animated, cheerful expression and the jovial smile around his thick
moustache suddenly disappeared. She saw that she had been cruel; and
she felt remorse for it. And for the first time, suddenly, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>she
saw that, in love with his wife though he was, he did not approve of
her withdrawing herself from everything. She saw that it gave him pain.
It was as though this side of his character were being made clear to
her: she was seeing it plainly for the first time.</p>
<p>He did not know what to reply: seeking for his words, he remained
silent.</p>
<p>Then she said, coaxingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, resident. It wasn&rsquo;t nice of me. I
know that all that sort of bustle only bores Mrs. van Oudijck. I am
glad to relieve her of it. I will do anything you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes were filled with nervous tears.</p>
<p>He was smiling now and gave her a penetrating sidelong glance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit overstrung. But I knew that you had a good
heart &hellip; and would not leave me in the lurch &hellip; and would
consent to help poor old Mother Staats. But don&rsquo;t throw away any
money, mevrouwtje: no expense, no new scenery. Just your wit, your
talent, your beautiful elocution: French or Dutch, as you please.
We&rsquo;re proud of all that at Labuwangi, you know; and all the
beautiful acting&mdash;which you give us free of charge&mdash;is quite
enough to make the performance a success. But how overstrung you are,
mevrouwtje! Why are you crying? Aren&rsquo;t you well? Tell me: is
there anything I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t work my husband so hard, resident. I never see
anything of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a gesture to show that he could not help himself:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an
awful lot to do. Is that the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And make me see the good side of India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is <i>that</i> it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a lot besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you becoming homesick? Don&rsquo;t you care for India any
longer, don&rsquo;t you care for Labuwangi, where we all make so much
of you?&hellip; You misjudge India. Try to see the good side of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it no use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too sensible not to perceive the good in this
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too fond of it to be impartial. And I don&rsquo;t
know how to be impartial. But tell me the good things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which shall I begin with? The satisfaction of being able, as
an official, to do good to the country and the people. The fine,
delightful sense of working for this country and this people; the ample
hard work that fills a man&rsquo;s life out here&#8202;&hellip;.
I&rsquo;m not speaking of all the office-work of your husband, who is
district secretary. But I&rsquo;m speaking of later on, when he becomes
an assistant-resident!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be so long before that happens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, the spacious material life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white ants gnaw everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a poor joke, mevrouw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very possibly, resident. Everything is out of tune with me,
inside and out: my wit, my piano and my poor soul.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nature, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel it all. Nature is conquering me and
devouring me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your own activities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My activities? One of the good things in India?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. To inspire us material, practical people with your wit,
now and again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resident! You&rsquo;re paying me compliments!&hellip; Is this
all on account of the theatricals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to do good to Mother Staats with that wit of
yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I do good in Europe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, certainly,&rdquo; he said, bluffly. &ldquo;Go to
Europe, mevrouw, by all means. Go and live at the Hague; join the
Charity Organization Society &hellip; with a collecting-box at your
door and a rix-dollar &hellip; how often?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re becoming unjust. They do a lot of good in
Holland too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do they ever do in Holland for <i>one</i> distressed
person &hellip; what we, what <i>you</i> are now going to do for Mother
Staats? And don&rsquo;t tell me that there&rsquo;s less poverty
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, there is a great deal of good for you here. Your
special activities. Your material and moral work for
others&#8202;&hellip;. Don&rsquo;t let Van Helderen get too much
smitten with you, mevrouw. He&rsquo;s a charming fellow, but he puts
too much literature into his monthly reports&#8202;&hellip;. I see him
coming and I must be off. So I can rely on you?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When shall we have the first meeting, with the committee and
the ladies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow evening, resident, at your house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are. I shall send round the subscription-lists. We
must make a lot of money, mevrouw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our best for Mother Staats,&rdquo; she said,
gently.</p>
<p>He shook her hand and went away. She felt limp, she did not know
why:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The resident has been warning me against you, because
you&rsquo;re too literary!&rdquo; she said to Van Helderen,
teasingly.</p>
<p>She sat down in the front verandah. The skies burst asunder; a white
curtain of rain descended in perpendicular streams. A plague of locusts
came hopping along the verandah. A cloud of tiny flies hummed in the
corners like an &AElig;olian harp. Eva and Van Helderen placed their
hands on the little table and it tilted its leg with a jerk, while the
beetles buzzed around them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">The subscription-lists went round. The plays
were rehearsed and performed in three weeks&rsquo; time; and the
committee handed the resident a sum of nearly fifteen hundred guilders
for Mother Staats. Her debts were paid; a little house was rented for
her; and she was set up in a small milliner&rsquo;s shop, which Eva
stocked from Paris. All the ladies in Labuwangi gave Mother Staats an
order; and in less than a month not only was the woman saved from utter
ruin, but her mode of life was established, her children were going to
school again and she was enjoying a pleasant livelihood. All this had
happened so swiftly and unostentatiously; the subscriptions were so
munificent; the ladies so readily ordered a dress or a hat which they
did not need that Eva was astounded. And she had to confess to herself
that the egoism, the self-absorption, the unlovable qualities which she
often observed in their social life&mdash;in their intercourse,
conversation, intriguing and gossip&mdash;had been suddenly thrust into
the background by a common gift for doing the right thing, quite
simply, because it had to be done, because there was no question about
it, because the woman had to be assisted. Roused from her depression by
the bustle of the rehearsals, stimulated to brisk action, she
appreciated the better and finer side of her environment and wrote of
it so enthusiastically <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href=
"#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>to Holland that her parents, to
whom India was a closed book, smiled. But, although this episode had
awakened a soft and gentle and appreciative feeling in her, it was only
an episode; and she remained the same when the emotion of it was over.
And, notwithstanding that she felt the disapproval of Labuwangi around
her, she continued to find the main interest of her life in Van
Helderen&rsquo;s friendship.</p>
<p>For there was so little else. Her little circle of adherents, which
she had gathered round her with so many illusions, which she invited to
dinner, to which her doors were always open: what did it actually
amount to? She now accepted the Doorn de Bruijns and the Rantzows as
indifferent acquaintances, but no longer as friends. She suspected Mrs.
Doorn de Bruijn of insincerity; Dr. Rantzow was too common, too vulgar;
his wife was an insignificant German <i>Hausfrau</i>. True, they joined
in the table-turning, but they relished the absurd ineptitudes, the
indecent conversation of the mocking spirit. She and Van Helderen took
the whole thing seriously, though she thought the table rather comical.
And so no one but Van Helderen remained to interest her.</p>
<p>But Van Oudijck had won her admiration. She had suddenly obtained a
glimpse of his character; and, though it entirely lacked the artistic
charm which had hitherto exclusively attracted her in men, she saw the
fine quality also in this man, who was not at all artistic, who had not
the least conception of art, but who had so much that was beautiful in
his simple, manly idea of duty and in the calmness with which he
endured the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>disappointment of his domestic life. For Eva saw
that, though he adored his wife, he did not approve of
L&eacute;onie&rsquo;s indifference to all the interests of which his
own life was built up. If he saw nothing more, if he was blind to all
the rest that went on in his domestic circle, this disappointment was
his secret pain, to which he was not blind, deep down in himself.</p>
<p>And she admired him; and her admiration was as it were a revelation
that art does not always stand highest in the affairs of this life. She
suddenly understood that the exaggerated importance attaching to art in
our time was a disease from which she had suffered and was still
suffering. For what was she, what did she do? Nothing. Her parents,
both of them, were great artists, true artists; and their house was
like a temple and their bias was comprehensible and pardonable. But
what of her? She played the piano pretty well; and that was all. She
had a few ideas, a little taste; and that was all. But in her time she
had gushed with other girls; and she now remembered all that foolish
gushing, that trick of exchanging letters crammed with cheap philosophy
and written in a modern style distantly aping that of the poets Kloos
and Gorter. And thus, for all her depression, her meditation carried
her a stage further and she underwent a certain development. For it
seemed incredible that she, the child of her parents, should not always
place art above everything else.</p>
<p>And she had in her that play and counterplay of seeking and thinking
in order to find her way, now that she was quite lost in a country
alien to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>her nature, among people on whom she looked
down, without letting them perceive it. She strove to find the good in
the country, in order to make it her own and cherish it; she was glad
to find among the people those few who roused her sympathy and her
admiration; but the good remained incidental to her, the few people
remained exceptional; and, despite all her seeking and thinking, she
did not find her way and retained the moodiness of a woman who was too
European, too artistic, notwithstanding her self-knowledge and her
consequent denial of her artistic capacity, to live quietly and
contentedly in an up-country Javanese town, beside a husband wrapped up
in his office-work, in a climate that upset her health, amid natural
surroundings that overwhelmed her and among people whom she
disliked.</p>
<p>And, in the most lucid moments of this play and counterplay, there
was the obvious fear, the fear which she felt most definitely of all,
the fear which she felt slowly approaching, she knew not whence, she
knew not whither, but hovering over her head as with the thousand veils
of a fate gliding through the sultry, rain-laden
skies&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>In these inharmonious moods, she had refrained from gathering her
little clique around her, for she herself did not care to take the
trouble and her friends did not understand her well enough to seek her
out. They missed the cheerfulness in her which had attracted them at
first. Envy and hostility were now given more rein; people began to
speak freely of her: she was affected, pedantic, vain, proud; she had
the pretention always to aim at being the leading person in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>town; she behaved just as though she were the
resident&rsquo;s wife and ordered every one about. She was not really
pretty, she had an impossible way of dressing, her house was
preposterously arranged. And then her relation with Van Helderen, their
evening walks to the light-house! Ida heard about it at Tosari, amid
the band of gossips at the small, poky hotel, where the visitors are
bored when they are not going on excursions and therefore sit about in
their poky little verandahs, almost in one another&rsquo;s pockets,
peeping into one another&rsquo;s rooms, listening at the thin
partitions; Ida heard about it at Tosari and it was enough to rouse the
little Indian woman&rsquo;s instincts, the instincts of a white
half-caste, and induce her suddenly, without stating any cause, to
remove her children from Eva&rsquo;s charge. Van Helderen, when he went
up for the week-end, asked his wife for an explanation, asked her why
she insulted Eva by taking the children away, without a reason, and
having them up in the hills, thus increasing the hotel-bills. Ida made
a scene, talking loudly, with hysterics that rang through the little
hotel, made all the visitors prick up their ears and, like a gale of
wind, whipped the cackling chatter into a storm. And, without further
explanation, Ida broke with Eva.</p>
<p>Eva withdrew into herself. Even in Surabaya, where she went to do
some shopping, she heard the scandalous chatter; and she became so sick
of her world and her friends that she silently shrank back into
herself. She wrote to Van Helderen not to call any more. She entreated
him to become reconciled with his wife. She gave up <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>seeing him. And she was now all alone. She felt
that she was not in the mood to find comfort in any one around her.
There was no sympathy and no understanding in India for such moods as
hers. And so she shut herself up. Her husband was working hard, as
usual. But she devoted herself more zealously to her little boy, she
immersed herself in her love for her child. She withdrew herself into
her love for her house. Well, this was her life of never going out, of
never seeing any one, of never hearing any other music than her own.
This was seeking comfort in her house, her child and her books. This
was the personality that she had become, after her early illusions and
strivings. She now constantly felt the yearning for Europe, for
Holland, for her parents, for people of artistic culture. And now it
developed into hatred for the country which she had at first seen in
the overwhelming grandeur of its beauty, with its majestic mountains
and the softly-creeping mystery that lurked in nature and humanity. Now
she hated nature and humanity; and their mystery terrified her.</p>
<p>She filled her life with thoughts of her child. Her boy, little
Otto, was three years old. She would guide him, make a man of him. From
the day of his birth she had had vague illusions of later seeing her
son a great artist, by preference a great writer, famous throughout the
world. But she had learnt much since then. She felt that art does not
always stand supreme. She felt that there are higher things, which
sometimes, in her despondency, she denied, but which were there
nevertheless, radiant and great. These <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb220" href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>things had to do with
the shaping of the future; these things had to do above all with peace,
justice and brotherhood. Oh, the great brotherhood of the poor and the
rich! Now, in her loneliness, she contemplated this as the highest
ideal at which one can work, as sculptors work on a monument. Justice
and peace would follow. But human brotherhood must be aimed at first;
and she wished her son to work at it. Where? In Europe? In India? She
did not know; she did not see it before her. She saw it in Europe
rather than in India, where the inexplicable, the enigmatical, the
fearful remained in the foreground of her thoughts. How strange it was,
how strange!&hellip;</p>
<p>She was a woman made for ideals. Perhaps this by itself was the
simple explanation of what she felt and feared &hellip; in
India&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your impressions of India are altogether mistaken,&rdquo; her
husband would say. &ldquo;You see India quite wrongly. Quiet? You think
it&rsquo;s quiet here? Why should I have to work so hard in India, if
things were quiet at Labuwangi?&hellip; We have hundreds of interests
at heart, of Europeans and Javanese alike. Agriculture is studied as
eagerly in this country as anywhere. The population is increasing
steadily&#8202;&hellip;. Declining? A colony in which there is always
so much going on? That&rsquo;s one of Van Helderen&rsquo;s imbecile
ideas: speculative ideas, mere vapourings, which you just echo after
him&#8202;&hellip;. I can&rsquo;t understand the way in which you
regard India nowadays&#8202;&hellip;. There was a time when you had
eyes for all that was beautiful and interesting here. That time
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>seems to be past. You ought to go home for a
bit, really&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she knew that he would be very lonely without her; and for this
reason she refused to go. Later, when her boy was older, she would have
to go to Holland. But by then Eldersma would certainly be an
assistant-resident. At present he still had seventeen controllers and
district secretaries above him. It had been going on like this for
years, that looking towards promotion in the distant future. It was
like yearning after a mirage. Of ever becoming a resident he did not so
much as think. Assistant-resident for a couple of years or so; and then
to Holland, on a pension&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>She thought it a heart-breaking existence, slaving one&rsquo;s self
to death like that &hellip; for Labuwangi!&hellip;</p>
<p>She was down with malaria; and her maid, Saina, was giving her
massage, kneading her aching limbs with supple fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nuisance, Saina, when I&rsquo;m ill, for you to
be living in the compound. You&rsquo;d better move into the house this
evening, with your four children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saina thought it troublesome, a great fuss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the woman explained. Her cottage had been left to her by her
husband. She was attached to it, though it was in an utterly
dilapidated condition. Now that the rainy monsoon was on, the rain
often came in through the roof; and then she was unable to cook and the
children had to go without their food. To have it repaired was
difficult. She had a rix-dollar a week from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>the
mem-sahib. Sixty cents of that went on rice. Then there were a few
cents daily for fish, coconut oil, betel-pepper; a few cents for
fuel&#8202;&hellip;. No, repairs were out of the question. She would be
much better off with the mem-sahib, much better off on the estate. But
it would be such a fuss to find a tenant for the cottage, because it
was so dilapidated; and the mem-sahib knew that no house was allowed to
remain unoccupied in the compound: there was a heavy fine attached to
that&#8202;&hellip;. So she would rather go on living in her damp
cottage. She could easily stay and sit up with the mem-sahib at night;
her eldest girl would look after the little ones.</p>
<p>And, resigned to her small existence of petty miseries, Saina passed
her supple fingers, with a firm, gentle pressure, over her
mistress&rsquo; ailing limbs.</p>
<p>And Eva thought it heart-rending, this living on a rix-dollar a
week, with four children, in a house which let in the rain, so that it
was impossible to cook there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me look after your second little daughter, Saina,&rdquo;
said Eva, a day or two after.</p>
<p>Saina hesitated, smiled: she would rather not, but dared not say
so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Eva insisted, &ldquo;let her come to me: you will
see her all day long; she will sleep in cook&rsquo;s room; I shall
provide her clothes; and she will have nothing to do but to see that my
room is kept tidy. You can teach her that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So young still, mem-sahib; only just ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Eva insisted. &ldquo;Let me do this to help
you. What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223"
href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mina, mem-sahib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mina? That won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said Eva.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the seamstress&rsquo; name. We&rsquo;ll find
another for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saina brought the child, looking very shy, with a streak of moist
rice-powder on her forehead; and Eva dressed her prettily. She was a
very attractive little thing, with a soft brown skin covered with a
downy bloom, and looked charming in her new clothes. She sedulously
piled the sarongs in the press, with fragrant white flowers between the
layers: the flowers were changed for fresh ones daily. For a joke,
because she arranged the flowers so prettily, Eva called her Melati,
after the East-Indian jasmine.</p>
<p>Two days later, Saina crouched down before her <i>njonja</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Saina?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Might the little girl come back to the damp cottage in the compound?
Saina asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Eva, in amazement. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t your
little girl happy here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, she was, said Saina, bashfully, but she preferred the cottage.
The mem-sahib was very kind, but little Mina would rather be in the
cottage.</p>
<p>Eva was angry and let the child go home, with the new clothes, which
Saina took away with her as a matter of course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t the child allowed to stay?&rdquo; Eva asked
of the <i>latta</i> cook.</p>
<p>Cook at first dared not say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, cook, why wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; asked Eva,
insisting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the mem-sahib called the little girl <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>Melati&#8202;&hellip;. Names of flowers and
fruits &hellip; are given only &hellip; to dancing-girls,&rdquo;
explained the cook, as though expounding a mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t Saina tell me?&rdquo; asked Eva, greatly
incensed. &ldquo;I had not the least idea of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too shy,&rdquo; said cook, by way of excusing Saina.
&ldquo;Beg pardon, mem-sahib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were trivial incidents in the daily domestic life, little
episodes of her housekeeping; but they made her feel sore, because she
felt behind them as it were a wall that always existed between her and
the people and things of India. She did not know the country, she would
never know the people.</p>
<p>And the minor disappointment of the episodes filled her with the
same soreness as the greater disappointment of her illusions, because
her life, amid the daily trivialities of her housekeeping, was itself
becoming more and more trivial. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">The early hours of the day were often cool,
washed clean by the abundant rains; and in the young sunshine of these
morning hours the earth emitted a tender haze, a blue softening of
every hard line and colour, so that the Lange Laan, with its
villa-residences and fenced gardens, seemed to be surrounded with the
vagueness and beauty of a dream-avenue: the dream-columns rose
insubstantially, like a vision of pillared tranquillity; the lines of
the roofs acquired distinction in their indefiniteness; the hues of the
trees and the outlines of their leafy tops were etherealized into
tender pastels of misty rose and even mistier blue, with a single
brighter gleam of morning yellow and a distant purple streak of dawn.
And over all this matutinal world fell a cool dew, like a fountain that
rose from that drenched ground and fell back in pearly drops in the
child-like gentleness of the first sunbeams. It was as though every
morning the earth and her people were newly created, as though mankind
were newly born to a youth of innocence and paradisal unconsciousness.
But the illusion of the dawn lasted but a minute, barely a few moments:
the sun, rising higher in the sky, shone forth from the virginal mist;
boastfully it unfurled its proud halo of piercing rays, pouring down
its burning gold, full of godlike pride because it was reigning
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>over its brief moment of the day, for the clouds
were already mustering, greyly advancing, like battle-hordes of dark
phantoms, pressing eerily onwards: deep bluish-black and heavy
lead-grey phantoms, overmastering the sun and crushing the earth under
white torrents of rain. And the evening twilight, short and hurried,
letting fall veil upon veil of crape, was like an overwhelming
melancholy of earth, nature and life, in which one forgot that
paradisal moment of the morning; the white rain rustled down like a
flood-tide of melancholy; the road and the gardens were dripping,
drinking up the falling torrents until they shone like marshy pools and
flooded meadows in the dusky evening; a chill, spectral mist rose on
high with a slow movement as of ghostly draperies, which hovered over
the puddles; and the chilly houses, scantily lit with their smoking
lamps, round which clouds of insects swarmed, falling on every hand and
dying with singed wings, became filled with a yet chillier sadness, an
over-shadowing fear of the menacing world out of doors, of the
all-powerful cloud-hordes, of the boundless immensity that came
whispering on the gusty winds from the far-off unknown, high as the
heavens, wide as the firmament, against which the open houses appeared
unprotected, while the inmates were small and petty for all their
civilization and science and soulful feelings, small as wriggling
insects, insignificant, abandoned to the play of the giant mysteries
blowing up from the distance.</p>
<p>L&eacute;onie van Oudijck, in the half-lit back-verandah of the
residency, was talking to Theo in a soft voice: and Oorip squatted
beside her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nonsense, Oorip!&rdquo; she cried, peevishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really not, mem-sahib,&rdquo; said the maid.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not nonsense. I hear them every evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Theo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the banyan-tree behind the house, high up, in the top
branches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wild cats,&rdquo; said Theo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not wild cats, sahib,&rdquo; the maid insisted.
&ldquo;Come, come! As if Oorip didn&rsquo;t know how wild cats mew!
Kriow, kriow: that&rsquo;s how they go. What we hear every night is the
ghosts. It&rsquo;s the little children crying in the trees. The souls
of the little children, crying in the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the wind, Oorip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, mem-sahib: as if Oorip couldn&rsquo;t hear the
wind! Boo-ooh: that&rsquo;s how the wind goes; and then the branches
move. But this is the little children, moaning in the top boughs; and
the branches don&rsquo;t move then. This is a bad omen,
mem-sahib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should it be a bad omen<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2932" title="Source: .">?</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oorip knows but dares not tell. The mem-sahib is sure to be
angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Oorip, tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because of the excellency, sahib, because of the
<i>resid&egrave;n</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other day, with the evening-market in the square and the
fancy-fair for the white people in the gardens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day wasn&rsquo;t well-chosen, according to the portents.
It was an unlucky day&#8202;&hellip;. And with the new
well&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href=
"#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the new well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no sacrifice. So no one uses the new well. Every
one fetches water from the old well&#8202;&hellip;. The water&rsquo;s
not good either. For from the new well the woman rises with the
bleeding hole in her breast&#8202;&hellip;. And Miss
Doddie&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Doddie has seen the white hadji going by! The white
hadji is not a good hadji. He&rsquo;s a ghost&#8202;&hellip;. Miss
Doddie saw him twice: at Patjaram and here&#8202;&hellip;. Listen,
mem-sahib!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear? The children&rsquo;s little souls are
moaning in the top boughs. There&rsquo;s no wind blowing at this
moment. Listen, listen: that&rsquo;s not wild cats. The wild cats go
kriow, kriow, when they&rsquo;re courting! These are the little
souls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all three listened. L&eacute;onie mechanically pressed closer
to Theo. She looked deathly pale. The roomy back-verandah, with the
table always laid, stretched away in the dim light of a single hanging
lamp. The half-swamped back-garden gleamed wet out of the darkness of
the banyan-trees, full of pattering drops but motionless in the
impenetrable masses of their velvety foliage. And an inexplicable,
almost imperceptible crooning, like a gentle mystery of little
tormented souls, whimpered high above their heads, as though in the sky
or in the topmost branches of the trees. Now it was a short cry, then a
moan as of a sick child, then a soft sobbing as of little girls in
misery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of animal can it be?&rdquo; asked Theo. &ldquo;Is
it birds or insects?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href=
"#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>The moaning and sobbing was very distinct. L&eacute;onie looked
white as a sheet and was trembling all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so frightened,&rdquo; said Theo. &ldquo;Of
course it&rsquo;s animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he himself was white as chalk with fear; and, when they looked
each other in the eyes, she understood that he too was afraid. She
clutched his arm, nestled up against him. The maid squatted low,
humbly, as though accepting all fate as an impenetrable mystery. She
did not wish to run away. But the eyes of the white man and woman held
only one idea, the idea of escaping. Suddenly, both of them, the
step-mother and the step-son, who were bringing shame upon the house,
were afraid, as with a single fear, afraid as of a threatening
punishment. They did not speak, they said nothing to each other; they
leant against each other, understanding each other&rsquo;s trembling,
two white children of this mysterious Indian soil, who from their
childhood had breathed the mystic air of Java and had unconsciously
heard the vague, stealthily approaching mystery, as an accustomed
music, a music which they had not noticed, as though mystery were an
accustomed thing. As they stood thus, trembling and looking at each
other, the wind rose, bearing away with it the secret of the tiny
souls, bearing away with it the little souls themselves; the
interlacing branches swayed angrily and the rain began to fall once
more. A shuddering chill came fanning up, filling the house; a sudden
draught blew out the lamp. And they remained in the dark, a little
longer, she, despite the openness of the verandah, almost <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>in
the arm of her step-son and lover; the maid crouching at their feet.
But then she flung off his arm, flung off the black oppression of
darkness and fear, filled with the rustling of the rain; the wind was
cold and shivery and she staggered indoors, on the verge of fainting.
Theo and Oorip followed her. The middle gallery was lighted. Van
Oudijck&rsquo;s office was open. He was working. L&eacute;onie stood
irresolute, with Theo, not knowing what to do. The maid disappeared,
muttering. It was then that she heard a whizzing sound and a small
round stone flew through the gallery, fell somewhere near at hand. She
gave a cry; and, behind the screen which divided the gallery from the
office where Van Oudijck sat at his writing-table, she flung herself
once more into Theo&rsquo;s arms, abandoning all her caution. They
stood shivering in each other&rsquo;s arms. Van Oudijck had heard her:
he stood up, came from behind the screen. His eyes blinked, as though
tired with working. L&eacute;onie and Theo had recovered
themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, L&eacute;onie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she said, not daring to tell him of the
little souls or of the stone, afraid of the threatening punishment.</p>
<p>She and Theo stood there like criminals, both of them white and
trembling. Van Oudijck, his mind still on his work, did not notice
anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;The mat is frayed and
&hellip; and I nearly stumbled. But there was something I wanted to
tell you, Otto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice shook, but he did not hear it, blind to what she did, deaf
to what she said, still absorbed in his papers: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oorip has suggested that the servants would like to have a
sacrifice, because a new well has been built in the
grounds&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That well which is two months old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t make use of the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are superstitious, you know; they refuse to use the
water before the sacrifice has been offered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it ought to have been done at once. Why didn&rsquo;t
they tell Kario at once to ask me? I can&rsquo;t think of all that
nonsense myself. But I would have given them the sacrifice then. Now
it&rsquo;s like mustard after meat. The well is two months
old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a good thing all the same, Papa,&rdquo; said
Theo. &ldquo;You know what the Javanese are like: they won&rsquo;t use
the well as long as they&rsquo;ve not had a sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Van Oudijck, unwillingly, shaking his head.
&ldquo;To give them a sacrifice now would have no sense in it. I would
have done so gladly; but now, after two months, it would be absurd.
They ought to have asked for it at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do, Otto,&rdquo; L&eacute;onie entreated. &ldquo;I should
give them the sacrifice. You&rsquo;ll please me if you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma half-promised Oorip,&rdquo; Theo insisted gently.</p>
<p>They stood trembling before him, white in the face, like
petitioners. But he, weary and thinking of his papers, was seized with
a stubborn unwillingness, though he was seldom able to refuse his wife
anything. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, L&eacute;onie,&rdquo; he said, firmly. &ldquo;And you
must never promise things of which you&rsquo;re not certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned away, went round the screen and sat down to his work.</p>
<p>They looked at each other, the mother and the step-son. Slowly,
aimlessly, they moved away, to the front-verandah, where a moist,
dripping darkness drifted between the stately pillars. They saw a white
form coming through the swamped garden. They started, for they were now
afraid of everything, thinking at the sight of every figure of the
chastisement that would overtake them like some strange thing, if they
remained in the paternal house which they had covered with shame. But,
when they looked more closely, they saw that it was Doddie. She had
come home; she said, trembling, that she had been at Eva
Eldersma&rsquo;s. Actually she had been walking with Addie de Luce; and
they had sheltered from the rain in the compound. She was very pale,
she was trembling; but L&eacute;onie and Theo did not notice it in the
dark verandah, even as she herself did not see that her step-mother and
Theo were pale. She was trembling like that because in the
garden&mdash;Addie had brought her to the gate&mdash;stones had been
thrown at her. It must have been some impudent Javanese, who hated her
father and his house and his household; but, in the dark verandah,
where she saw her step-mother and her brother sitting side by side in
silence, as though in despair, she suddenly felt, she did not know why,
that it was not an impudent Javanese&#8202;&hellip;. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p>She sat down by them, silently. They looked out at the damp, dark
garden, over which the spacious night was hovering as on the wings of a
gigantic bat. And, in the mute melancholy which drifted like a grey
twilight between the tall white pillars, all three of them&mdash;Doddie
singly, but the step-mother and step-son together&mdash;felt frightened
to death and crushed by the strange thing that was about to befall
them&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234"

each other all the oftener, feeling themselves now bound by
indissoluble bonds. In the afternoon he would steal to her room; and,
despite their anxiety, they lost themselves in wild embraces and then
remained close together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be nonsense, L&eacute;onie,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but then what <i>is</i> it?&rdquo; she murmured in
return. &ldquo;After all, I heard the moaning and heard the stone whizz
through the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it <i>is</i> something &hellip; suppose it is something
that we can&rsquo;t explain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The moaning &hellip; of those animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that stone &hellip; must have been thrown by some

<p>&ldquo;Bribed? By whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By &hellip; by the regent&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Theo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oorip said the moaning came from the
palace&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that they wanted to torment papa from
there&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To torment him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the Regent of Ngadjiwa has been dismissed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Oorip say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>I</i> do. Oorip said that the regent had occult
powers. That&rsquo;s nonsense, of course. The fellow&rsquo;s a
scoundrel. He has bribed people &hellip; to worry papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But papa notices none of it&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&#8202;&hellip;. We mustn&rsquo;t tell him
either&#8202;&hellip;. That&rsquo;s the best thing to
do&#8202;&hellip;. We must ignore it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the white hadji, Theo, whom Doddie saw
twice&#8202;&hellip;. And, when they do table-turning at Van
Helderen&rsquo;s, Ida sees him too&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, another tool of the regent&rsquo;s, of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I expect that&rsquo;s true&#8202;&hellip;. But
it&rsquo;s wretched all the same, Theo&#8202;&hellip;. Theo darling,
I&rsquo;m so frightened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of that nonsense? Come, come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s anything, Theo &hellip; it has nothing to do
with <i>us</i>, you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What next? What could it have to do with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>us?
I tell you, it&rsquo;s a practical joke of the
regent&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We oughtn&rsquo;t to be together any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I love you, I&rsquo;m mad with love for
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed her fiercely. They were both afraid. But he rallied
L&eacute;onie:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, L&eacute;onie, don&rsquo;t be so
superstitious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a child, my babu told
me&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She whispered a story in his ear. He turned pale:</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&eacute;onie, what rot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange things happen here, in India&#8202;&hellip;. If they
bury something belonging to you, a pocket-handkerchief or a lock of
hair, they are able&mdash;simply by witchcraft&mdash;to make you fall
ill and pine away and die &hellip; and not a doctor can tell what the
illness is&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rubbish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were so superstitious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used never to think of it. I&rsquo;ve begun to think of it
just lately&#8202;&hellip;. Theo, <i>can</i> there be
anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing &hellip; but kissing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Theo, don&rsquo;t, be quiet, I&rsquo;m
frightened!&hellip; It&rsquo;s quite late. It gets dark so quickly.
Papa has finished his sleep, Theo. Go away now, Theo &hellip; through
the boudoir. I want to take my bath quickly. I&rsquo;m frightened
nowadays when it gets dark. There&rsquo;s no twilight, with the rains.
The evenings come all of a sudden&#8202;&hellip;. The other day, I had
not told them to bring a light into the bathroom &hellip; and already
it was so dark &hellip; at only half-past five &hellip; and two bats
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>were flying all over the place: I was so afraid
that they would catch in my hair&#8202;&hellip;. Hush! Is that
papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s Doddie: she&rsquo;s playing with her
cockatoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go now, Theo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went through the boudoir, and wandered into the garden. She got
up, flung a kimono over the sarong which she had knotted loosely under
her arms and called to Oorip:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring the bath-things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mem-sahib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you, Oorip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, mem-sahib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, outside the garden-door, mem-sahib&#8202;&hellip;. I
was waiting,&rdquo; said the girl, meaningly, implying that she was
waiting until Theo had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the excellency sahib up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes &hellip; had his bath, mem-sahib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then fetch the things for my bath&#8202;&hellip;. Light the
little lamp in the bathroom&#8202;&hellip;.<a id="xd26e3190" name=
"xd26e3190"></a> Yesterday evening the glass was broken and the lamp
not filled&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mem-sahib never used to have the lamp lit in the
bathroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oorip &hellip; has anything happened &hellip; this
afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, everything has been quiet&#8202;&hellip;. But oh, when
the night comes!&hellip; All the servants are frightened,
mem-sahib&#8202;&hellip;. Cook says she won&rsquo;t
stay&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a fuss!&hellip; Oorip, promise her five guilders
&hellip; as a present &hellip; if she stays&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The butler is frightened too, mem-sahib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a fuss!&hellip; I&rsquo;ve never known such a fuss,
Oorip&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mem-sahib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always been able to arrange matters so
well&#8202;&hellip;. But these are things&#8202;&hellip;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can one do, mem-sahib?&hellip; Things are stronger than
men&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mightn&rsquo;t it really be wild cats &hellip; and a man
throwing stones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, mem-sahib!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, bring my bath-things&#8202;&hellip;. Don&rsquo;t forget
to light the little lamp&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid left the room. The dusk began to fall softly through the
air, soft as velvet after the rain. The great residency stood still as
death amid the darkness of its giant banyans. And the lamps were not
yet lit. In the front-verandah, Van Oudijck, by himself, lay in his
pyjamas on a wicker chair, drinking tea. In the garden, the dense
shadows were gathering like strips of immaterial velvet falling heavily
from the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamp-boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mem-sahib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, light the lamps! Why do you begin so late? Light the
lamp in my bedroom first&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went to the bathroom. She went past the long row of store-rooms
and servants&rsquo; rooms which shut off the back-garden. She looked up
at the banyan-tree in whose top branches she had heard the little souls
moaning. The branches did not move, there was not a breath of wind, the
air was sultry and oppressive with a threatening storm, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>with
rain too heavy to fall. In the bathroom, Oorip was lighting the little
lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you brought everything, Oorip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mem-sahib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you forgotten the big bottle with the white
toilet-water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this it, mem-sahib?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right&#8202;&hellip;. But do give me a fine
towel for my face in future. I&rsquo;m always telling you to give me a
fine towel. I hate these coarse ones&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run and fetch one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! Stay here, stay and sit by the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mem-sahib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you must have the keys seen to by a
locksmith&#8202;&hellip;. We can&rsquo;t lock the
bathroom-door&#8202;&hellip;. It&rsquo;s too silly, when there are
visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you don&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shut the door. The maid squatted down outside the closed door,
patient and resigned under the big and little things of life, knowing
nothing but loyalty to her mistress, who loaded her with pretty sarongs
and paid her wages in advance as often as she wanted them.</p>
<p>In the bathroom the little nickel lamp gleamed faintly over the
pale-green marble of the wet floor; over the water brimming in the
square sunk bath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have my evening bath a little earlier in
future,&rdquo; thought L&eacute;onie.</p>
<p>She removed her kimono and sarong; and, standing naked, she glanced
in the mirror at her soft, milk-white contours, the rounded outlines
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>of an amorous woman. Her fair hair shone like
gold; and a pearly lustre spread from her shoulders over her bosom and
vanished in the shadow of her small, round breasts. She lifted her
hair, admiring herself, examining herself for a chance wrinkle, feeling
whether her flesh was hard and firm. One of her hips arched outwards,
as she rested her weight on one leg; and a long white high-light curved
caressingly past her thigh and knee, disappearing at the instep. But
she gave a start as she stood thus absorbed in admiration: she had
meant to hurry. She quickly tied her hair into a knot, covered herself
with a lather of soap and, taking the scoop, poured the water over her
body. It flowed heavily down her in long smooth streams; and her
gleaming shoulders, breasts and hips shone like marble in the light of
the little lamp&#8202;&hellip;. Yes, she would bathe earlier in future.
It was already dark outside.</p>
<p>She dried herself hurriedly, with a rough towel. She just rubbed
herself, briskly, with the white ointment which Oorip always prepared,
her magic elixir of youth, suppleness and firm
whiteness&#8202;&hellip;. At that moment, she saw on her thigh a small
red spot. She paid no attention to it, thinking that there must have
been something in the water, a tiny leaf, a dead insect. She rubbed it
off. But, while rubbing herself, she saw two or three larger spots,
deep scarlet, on her chest. She turned suddenly cold, not knowing what
it was, not understanding. She rubbed herself down again; and she took
the towel, on which the spots had left something slimy, like clotted
blood. A shiver ran over her from head to foot. And suddenly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>she saw. The spots came out of the corners of
the bathroom&mdash;how and where she did not see&mdash;first small,
then large, as though spat out by a dribbling, betel-chewing mouth.
Cold as ice, she gave a scream. The spots, now closer together, became
full, like blobs of purple saliva spat against her. Her body was soiled
and filthy with a grimy, dribbling redness. One spot struck her in the
eye&#8202;&hellip;.<a id="xd26e3268" name="xd26e3268"></a></p>
<p>The slimy blobs of spittle marked the greenish white of the floor
and floated in the water that had not yet run off. They also fouled the
water in the bath and dissolved in filth. She was all red, stained and
unclean, as though defiled by a foul scarlet shame which invisible
betel-chewing mouths hawked and spat upon her from the corners of the
room, aiming at her hair, her eyes, her breasts, her flanks. She
uttered yell upon yell, driven crazy by the strangeness of what was
happening. She rushed to the door, tried to open it, but there was
something amiss with the handle. For the key was not turned in the
lock, the bolt was not shot. She felt her back spat upon again and
again; and the red dripped off her. She screamed for Oorip and heard
the girl outside the door, pulling and pushing.</p>
<p>At last the door yielded. And, desperate, mad, distraught, insane,
naked, befouled, she threw herself into her maid&rsquo;s arms. The
servants came running up. She saw Van Oudijck, Theo and <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e3274" title="Source: Doddy">Doddie</span> hastening
from the back-verandah. In her utter madness, with her eyes staring
widely, she felt ashamed not of her nudity but of her defilement. The
maid had snatched the kimono, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242"
href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>also befouled, from the
handle of the door and threw it round her mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep away!&rdquo; L&eacute;onie yelled, desperately.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come any nearer!&rdquo; she screamed, madly.
&ldquo;Oorip, Oorip, take me to the swimming-bath! A lamp, a lamp
&hellip; in the swimming-bath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, L&eacute;onie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She refused to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &hellip; trodden &hellip; on a &hellip;
toad!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid &hellip; of
itch!&hellip; Don&rsquo;t come any nearer! I&rsquo;ve <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e3288" title="Source: get">got</span> nothing
on!&hellip; Keep away! Keep away!&hellip; A lamp, a lamp &hellip; a
<i>lamp</i>, I tell you &hellip; in the swimming-bath!&hellip; No,
Otto! Keep away! Keep away! I&rsquo;m undressed! Keep away!&hellip;
Bring a la-amp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servants scurried past one another. One of them brought a lamp
to the swimming-bath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oorip! Oorip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clutched her maid:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve spat at me &hellip; with betel-juice!&hellip;
They&rsquo;ve spat &hellip; at me &hellip; with betel-juice!&hellip;
They&rsquo;ve spat &hellip; at me &hellip; with betel-juice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, mem-sahib!&hellip; Come along &hellip; to the
swimming-bath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wash me, Oorip!&hellip; Oorip, my hair, my eyes!&hellip; O
God, I can taste it in my mouth!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sobbed despairingly; the maid dragged her along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oorip! First look &hellip; look and see &hellip; if
they&rsquo;re spitting &hellip; in the swimming-bath too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid went in, shivering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing there, mem-sahib.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick then, Oorip, bathe me, wash me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flung off the kimono; her beautiful body became visible in the
light of the lamp, as though soiled with dirty blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oorip, wash me&#8202;&hellip;. No, don&rsquo;t go for soap:
water will do!&hellip; Don&rsquo;t leave me alone! Oorip, wash me here,
can&rsquo;t you?&hellip; Burn the kimono! Oorip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ducked in the swimming-bath and swam round desperately; the
maid, half-undressed, went in after her and washed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Oorip! Quick: only the worst places!&hellip; I&rsquo;m
frightened! Presently &hellip; presently they&rsquo;ll be spitting
here!&hellip; In the bedroom next, Oorip!&hellip; Call out that
there&rsquo;s to be no one in the garden! I won&rsquo;t put the kimono
on again! Quickly, Oorip, call out! I want to get away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid called across the garden, in Javanese.</p>
<p>L&eacute;onie, all dripping, stepped out of the water and, naked and
wet, flew past the servants&rsquo; rooms, with the maid behind her.
Inside the house, Van Oudijck, frantic with anxiety, came running
towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away, Otto! Leave me alone! I&rsquo;ve &hellip; I&rsquo;ve
got nothing on!&rdquo; she screamed.</p>
<p>And she rushed into her room and, when Oorip had followed her,
locked all the doors.</p>
<p>In the garden, the servants crept together, under the sloping roof
of the verandah, close to the house. The thunder was muttering softly
and a silent rain was beginning to fall&#8202;&hellip;. <span class=

<p class="first dropcap">L&eacute;onie kept her bed for a couple of
days with nervous fever. People at Labuwangi said that the residency
was haunted. At the weekly assemblies in the Municipal Garden, when the
band played and the children and the young people danced on the
open-air stone floor, there were whispered conversations around the
refreshment-tables touching the strange happenings in the residency.
Dr. Rantzow was asked many questions, but could only tell what the
resident had told him, what Mrs. van Oudijck herself had told him, of
her being frightened in the bathroom by an enormous toad, on which she
had trodden and stumbled. There was more known through the servants,
however; though, when one spoke of the throwing of stones and the
spitting of betel-juice, another laughed and called it all babu-talk.
And so uncertainty prevailed. Nevertheless, the papers throughout the
country, from Surabaya to Batavia, contained curious, hinting
paragraphs, which were not very lucid but which suggested a good
deal.</p>
<p>Van Oudijck himself discussed the matter with nobody, neither with
his wife and children nor with the officials or the servants. But on
one occasion he came out of the bathroom looking deathly pale, with
eyes staring wildly. He went indoors quietly, however, and pulled
himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>together; and no one noticed anything. Then he
spoke to the chief of police. There was an old graveyard next to the
residency-grounds. This was now watched day and night; also the outer
wall of the bathroom. The bathroom itself was no longer used; they took
their baths instead in the visitors&rsquo; bathroom.</p>
<p>As soon as Mrs. van Oudijck had recovered, she went to stay with
friends at Surabaya. She did not return. She had gradually, and
unostentatiously, without a word to Van Oudijck, made Oorip pack up her
clothes and all sorts of knick-nacks to which she was attached. Trunk
upon trunk was sent after her. When Van Oudijck happened to go to her
bedroom one day, he found it empty of all but the furniture. Numberless
things had disappeared also from her boudoir. He had not observed the
dispatch of the trunks, but he now understood that she would not
return. He cancelled his next reception. It was December; and
Ren&eacute; and Ricus were to come from Batavia for the Christmas
holidays, for a week or ten days; but he cancelled the boys&rsquo;
visit. Then Doddie was invited to stay at Patjaram, with the De Luce
family. Although, with the instinct of a full-blooded Hollander, he did
not like the De Luces, he consented. They were fond of Doddie there:
she would have a better time than at Labuwangi. He had given up his
idea, the hope that Doddie would not become Indianized. Suddenly, Theo
also went away: through L&eacute;onie&rsquo;s influence with commercial
magnates at Surabaya, he obtained a well-paid berth in an
export-and-import business. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href=
"#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span></p>
<p>Van Oudijck was left all alone in his big house. As the cook and the
butler had run away, Eldersma and Eva constantly asked him to meals,
both to lunch and dinner. He never mentioned his house at their table
and it was never discussed. What he discussed confidentially with
Eldersma, as secretary, and with Van Helderen, as controller, these two
never mentioned, treating it all as an official secret. The chief of
police, who had been accustomed daily to make his brief
report&mdash;that nothing particular had happened, or that there had
been a fire, or that a man had been wounded&mdash;now made long, secret
reports, with the doors of the office locked, to prevent the messengers
outside from listening. Gradually all the servants ran away, departing
stealthily in the night, with their families and their household
belongings, leaving their huts in the compound empty and dirty. They
did not even stay in the residency. Van Oudijck let them go. He kept
only Kario and the messengers; and the prisoners tended the garden
daily. Thus the house remained apparently unaltered, outside. But,
inside, where nothing was looked after, the dust lay thick on the
furniture, white ants devoured the mats, mildew and patches of moisture
came through the walls. The resident never went about the house,
occupying only his bedroom and his office. His face began to wear a
look of gloom, like a bitter, silent doubt. He worked more
conscientiously than ever and stimulated his subordinates more
actively, as though he were thinking of nothing but the interests of
Labuwangi. In his isolated position, he had no friend and sought none.
He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>bore everything alone, on his own shoulders, on
his own back, which grew bent with approaching age: the heavy burden of
his house, which was being destroyed, and of his family life, which was
breaking up amid the strange happenings that escaped his police, his
watchmen, his personal vigilance and his secret spies. He discovered
nothing. Nobody told him anything. No one threw any light on
anything.</p>
<p>And the strange happenings continued. A mirror was smashed by a
great stone. Calmly he had the pieces cleared away. It was not his
nature to believe in the supernatural character of possibilities; and
he did not believe in it. He was secretly enraged at being unable to
discover the culprits and an explanation of the events. But he refused
to believe. He did not believe when he found his bed soiled and Kario,
squatting at his feet, swore that he did not know how it had happened.
He did not believe when the tumbler which he lifted broke into shivers.
He did not believe when he heard a constant, irritating hammering
overhead. But his bed was soiled, his glass did break, the hammering
was a fact. He investigated all these facts, as punctiliously as though
he were investigating a criminal case, and nothing came to light. He
remained unperturbed in his relations with his European and native
officials and with the regent. No one remarked anything in his
behaviour; and in the evenings he worked on, defiantly, at his
writing-table, while the hammering continued and the night fell softly
in the garden, as by enchantment.</p>
<p>On the steps outside, the messengers crept <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>together, listening and whispering, glancing
round timorously at their master who sat writing, with a frown of
concentration on his brows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he hear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, he&rsquo;s not deaf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks he can find it out through detectives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are soldiers coming from Ngadjiwa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Ngadjiwa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he does not trust the detectives. He has written to the
major sahib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To send soldiers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there are soldiers coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at him frowning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he just goes on working!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m frightened. I should never dare to stay, if I
hadn&rsquo;t got to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid to stay, as long as he&rsquo;s
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes &hellip; he&rsquo;s brave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s plucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a brave man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he doesn&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he doesn&rsquo;t know what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks it&rsquo;s rats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has had a search made for rats upstairs, under the
roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These Hollanders don&rsquo;t know things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He smokes a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, quite twelve cigars a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t drink much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No &hellip; only his whisky-and-soda of an
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll ask for it presently.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has stayed with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The others understood. They&rsquo;ve all left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He goes to bed very late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s working hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never sleeps at night, only in the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at him frowning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never stops working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messenger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s calling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, excellency?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring whisky-and-soda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the messengers rose, to fetch the drink. He had everything
ready to hand, in the visitors&rsquo; wing, to avoid having to go
through the house. The others pressed closer together and went on
whispering. The moon pierced the clouds and lit up the garden and the
pond as with a humid vapour of silent enchantment. The messenger had
mixed the drink; he returned, squatted and offered it to the
resident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it down,&rdquo; said Van Oudijck.</p>
<p>The messenger stood the tumbler on the writing-table and crept away.
The other messengers whispered together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messenger!&rdquo; cried Van Oudijck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you put in this glass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man trembled and shrank away at Van Oudijck&rsquo;s feet:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency, it&rsquo;s not poison; I swear it by my life, by
my death; I can&rsquo;t help it, excellency. Kick me, kill me: I
can&rsquo;t help it, excellency!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The glass was a dull yellow. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250"
href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Fetch another tumbler and fill it before me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The messenger went away, trembling.</p>
<p>The others sat close together, feeling the contact of one
another&rsquo;s bodies through the sweat-soaked cloth of their
liveries, and stared before them in dismay. The moon rose from its
clouds, laughing and mocking like a wicked fairy; its moist and silent
enchantment shone silver over the wide garden. In the distance, from
the garden at the back, a plaintive cry rang out, as though a child
were being throttled. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;And how are you, mevrouwtje? How&rsquo;s the
depression? Is India suiting you any better to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words sounded cheerful to Eva, as she saw him coming through the
garden, on the stroke of eight, for dinner. His tone expressed nothing
more than the gay greeting of a man who has been working hard at his
desk and is delighted to see a pretty woman at whose table he is about
to sit. She was filled with surprise and admiration. There was not a
suggestion of a man who is plagued all day long, in a deserted house,
by strange and incomprehensible happenings. There was hardly a shadow
of dejection on his wide forehead, hardly a care seemed to rest upon
his broad, slightly bowed back; and the jovial, smiling line about his
thick moustache was there as usual. Eldersma came up; and Eva divined
in his greeting, in his pressure of the hand, a silent freemasonry of
things known, of confidences shared in common. And Van Oudijck drank
his gin-and-bitters in a perfectly normal manner, spoke of a letter
from his wife, who was probably going on to Batavia, said that
Ren&eacute; and Ricus were staying in the Preanger<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3474src" href="#xd26e3474" name="xd26e3474src">1</a> with
friends who had a plantation there. He did not speak of the reason why
they were not with him, why he had been entirely abandoned <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>by
his family and servants. In the intimacy of their circle, which he now
visited twice a day for his meals, he had never spoken of this. And,
though Eva did not ask any questions, it was making her extremely
nervous. So close to the house, the haunted house, whose pillars she
could see by day in the distance, gleaming through the foliage of the
trees, she became more and more nervous daily. All day long, the
servants whispered around her and peered timidly at the haunted
residency. At night, unable to sleep, she strained her ears to hear
whether she could detect anything strange, the moaning of the little
children. The Indian night was so full of voices that it could but make
her shudder on her bed. Through the imperious bellowing of the frogs
for rain and rain and more rain still, the constant croaking on the one
bellowing note, she heard thousands of ghostly sounds that kept her
from sleeping. Through it all the lizards and geckos emitted their
clockwork strokes, like strange mysterious time-pieces.</p>
<p>She thought of it all day long. Eldersma did not speak of it either.
But, when she saw Van Oudijck come to lunch or dinner, she had to
compress her lips lest she should question him. And the conversation
touched upon all sorts of topics, but never upon the strange
happenings. After lunch, Van Oudijck went across to the residency
again; after dinner, at ten o&rsquo;clock, she saw him once more vanish
into the haunting shadow of the garden. With a calm step, every evening
he went back, through the enchanted night, to his wretched, deserted
house, where the messengers and Kario sat squatting close <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>together outside his office; and he worked until
late in the night. He never complained. He pursued his enquiries
closely, all through the district, but nothing came to light.
Everything continued to happen in impenetrable mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how does India suit you this evening,
mevrouwtje?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was always more or less the same pleasantry; but each time she
admired his tone. Courage, robust self-confidence, a certainty in his
own knowledge, a belief in what he knew for certain: all these rang in
his voice with metallic clearness. Miserable though he must
feel&mdash;he, the man of profoundly domestic inclinations and of cool,
practical sense&mdash;in a house deserted by those who belonged to him
and full of inexplicable happenings, there was not a trace of doubt or
dejection in his unfailing masculine simplicity. He went his way and
did his work, more conscientiously than ever; he continued his
investigations. And at Eva&rsquo;s table he always kept up an animated
conversation, on politics in India and the new craze for having India
ruled from Holland by lay-men who did not know even the A.B.C. of the
business. And he talked with an easy, pleasant vivacity, free from all
effort, till Eva came to admire him more and more.</p>
<p>But with her, a sensitive woman, it became a nervous obsession. And
once, in the evening, as she was walking a little way with him, she
asked him if it wasn&rsquo;t terrible, if he couldn&rsquo;t leave the
house, if he couldn&rsquo;t go on circuit, for a good long time. She
saw his face clouding at her questions. But still he answered kindly,
saying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>that it was not so bad, even though it was all
inexplicable, and that he would back himself to get to the bottom of
the conjuring. And he added that he really ought to be going on
circuit, but that he would not go, lest he should seem to be running
away. Then he hurriedly pressed her hand and told her not to upset
herself and not to think about it any more or talk about it. The last
words sounded like a friendly admonition. She pressed his hand again,
with tears in her eyes. And she watched him walk away, with his calm,
firm step, and disappear in the darkness of his garden, where the
enchantment must be creeping in through the croaking of the frogs. But
standing there like that made her shudder; and she hurried indoors. And
she felt that her house, that roomy house of hers, was small and unduly
open and defenceless against the vast Indian night, which could enter
from every side.</p>
<p>But she was not the only person obsessed by the mysterious
happenings. Their inexplicable nature lay like an oppression over the
whole town, so completely did it clash with the things of everyday
life. The mystery was discussed in every house, but only in a whisper,
lest the children should be frightened and the servants perceive that
people were impressed by the Javanese conjuring, as the resident
himself had called it. And the uneasiness and depression were making
everybody ill with apprehension and nervous listening when the darkness
was teeming with voices in the night, which drifted down on the town in
a dense, velvety greyness; and the town seemed to be hiding itself more
deeply than ever in the foliage <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255"
href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>of its gardens, seemed, in
these moist evening twilights, to be shrinking away altogether in dull,
silent resignation, bowing before the mystery.</p>
<p>Then Van Oudijck thought it time to take strong measures. He wrote
to the major commanding the garrison at Ngadjiwa to come over with a
captain, a couple of lieutenants and a company of soldiers. That
evening, the officers, with the resident and Van Helderen, dined at the
Eldersmas&rsquo;. They hurried through their meal; and Eva, standing at
the garden-gate, saw them all&mdash;the resident, the secretary, the
controller and the four officers&mdash;go into the dark garden of the
haunted house. The residency-grounds were shut off, the house
surrounded and the churchyard watched. The men went to the bathroom by
themselves.</p>
<p>They remained there all through the night. And all through the night
the grounds and house remained shut off and surrounded. They came out
at about five o&rsquo;clock and went straight to the swimming-bath and
bathed, all of them together. What had happened to them they did not
say, but they had had a terrible night. That morning the bathroom was
pulled down.</p>
<p>They had all promised Van Oudijck not to speak about that night; and
Eldersma would not tell anything to Eva, nor Van Helderen to Ida. The
officers too, on their return to Ngadjiwa, were silent. They merely
said that their night in the bathroom was too improbable for any one to
believe the story. At last one of the young lieutenants allowed a hint
of his adventures to escape him. And a tale of betel-juice-spitting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>and stone-throwing, of a floor that heaved,
while they struck at it with sticks and swords, and of something more,
something unutterably horrible that had happened in the water of the
bath, went the rounds. Every one added to it. When the story reached
Van Oudijck&rsquo;s ears, he hardly recognized it as an account of the
terrible night, which had been terrible enough without any
additions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Eldersma had written a report of their united vigil; and
they all signed the improbable story. Van Oudijck himself took the
report to Batavia and delivered it to the governor-general with his own
hands. Thenceforth it slumbered in the secret archives of the
government.</p>
<p>The governor-general advised Van Oudijck to go to Holland on leave
for a short period, assuring him that this leave would have no
influence on his promotion to a residency of the first class, which was
nearly due. He refused this favour, however, and returned to Labuwangi.
The only concession that he made was to move into Eldersma&rsquo;s
house until the residency should be thoroughly cleaned. But the flag
continued to wave from the flagstaff in the residency-grounds.</p>
<p>On his return from Batavia, Van Oudijck often met Sunario, the
regent, on matters of business. And, in his intercourse with the
regent, the resident remained stern and formal. Then he had a brief
interview, first with the regent and afterwards with his mother, the
raden-aju pang&eacute;ran. The two conversations did not last longer
than twenty minutes. But it appeared that those few words were of great
and portentous moment. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href=
"#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span></p>
<p>For the strange happenings ceased. When everything had been cleaned
and repaired, under Eva&rsquo;s supervision, Van Oudijck compelled
L&eacute;onie to come back, because he wished to give a great ball on
New Year&rsquo;s Day. In the morning, the resident received all his
European and native officials. In the evening, the guests streamed into
the brightly lit galleries from every part of the town, still inclined
to shudder and very inquisitive and instinctively looking around and
above them. And, while the champagne went round, Van Oudijck himself
took a glass and offered it to the regent with a deliberate breach of
etiquette; and, in a tone of solemn admonition mingled with
good-humoured jest, he uttered these words, which were seized upon and
repeated on every hand and which continued to be repeated for months
throughout Labuwangi:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink with an easy mind, regent. I give you <i>my word of
honour</i> that no more glasses will be broken in my house, except by
accident or carelessness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was able to say this because he knew that&mdash;this
time&mdash;he had been too strong for the hidden force, merely through
his simple courage as an official, a Hollander and a man.</p>
<p>But in the regent&rsquo;s gaze, as he drank, there was still a very
slight gleam of irony, intimating that, though the hidden force had not
conquered, this time, it would yet remain an enigma, forever
inexplicable to the short-sighted eyes of the Europeans&#8202;&hellip;.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">Labuwangi came to life again. It was as though
people unanimously agreed not to discuss the strange affair any further
with outsiders, because it was so excusable that any one should refuse
to believe in the thing; and they, at Labuwangi, believed. And the
up-country town, after the mystic oppression under which it had lain
cowering during those unforgettable weeks, came to life again, as
though shaking off all its obsession. Party followed upon party, ball
upon ball, theatricals upon concert: all threw open their doors to
entertain their friends and make merry, in order to feel natural and
normal after the incredible nightmare. People so accustomed to the
natural and tangible life, to the spacious and lavish material
existence of India&mdash;to good cooking, cool drinks, wide beds, roomy
houses, to everything that represents physical luxury to the European
in the east&mdash;such people breathed again and shook off the
nightmare, shook off the belief in strange happenings. If and when they
discussed the thing nowadays, they commonly called it that
incomprehensible conjuring&mdash;echoing the resident&mdash;the
regent&rsquo;s conjuring-tricks. For that the regent had something to
do with it was certain. That the resident had held a terrible threat
over him and his mother, if the strange happenings did not cease, was
certain. That, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>after this, order had been restored in everyday
life was certain. So it was conjuring. All were now ashamed of their
credulity and their fears and of having shuddered at what had looked
like mysticism and was only clever conjuring. And all breathed again
and made up their minds to be cheerful; and entertainment followed upon
entertainment.</p>
<p>L&eacute;onie, amid all this dissipation, forgot her irritation at
having been recalled by Van Oudijck. And she too was determined to
forget the scarlet pollution of her body. But something of its terror
lingered in her. She now bathed early of an afternoon, as early as
half-past four, in the newly-built bathroom. Her second bath always
gave her a certain shudder. And, now that Theo had a job at Surabaya,
she got rid of him, also, from terror. She could not get rid of the
idea that the enchantment had threatened to punish both of them, the
mother and son, who were bringing shame on the home. In the romantic
side of her perverse imagination, in her rosy fancy full of cherubs and
cupids, this idea, inspired by her fears, struck too precious a note of
tragedy for her not to cherish it, for all that Theo might say. She
would go no further. And it made him furious, because he was mad with
love for her, because he could not forget the shameful happiness which
he had enjoyed in her arms. But she steadily refused him and told him
of her dread and said that she was certain that the witchcraft would
begin again if they two loved each other, he and his father&rsquo;s
wife. Her words drove him scarlet with fury, on the one Sunday which he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>spent at Labuwangi: he was furious with her
non-compliance, with the motherly attitude which she now adopted and
with the fact, of which he was well aware, that she saw Addie often,
that she often went to stay at Patjaram. Addie danced with her at
parties and hung over her chair at concerts, in the improvised
residential box. True, he was not faithful to her, for it was not his
nature to love one woman&mdash;he loved women wholesale&mdash;but still
he was as faithful to her as he was able to be. He inspired her with a
more lasting passion than she had ever felt before; and this passion
roused her from her usual passive indifference. Often, in company,
suffering and inflicting boredom, enthroned in the brilliance of her
white beauty, like a smiling idol, with the langour of her years in
India gradually filling her blood until her movements had acquired that
lazy indifference for anything that did not spell love and caresses,
until her voice had assumed a drawling accent in any word that was not
a word of passion: often the flame which Addie shed over her would
transfigure into a younger woman, livelier in company, gayer, flattered
by the persistent homage of this youth, on whom every girl was mad.</p>
<p>And she delighted in monopolizing him as much as she could, to the
vexation of all the girls and of Doddie in particular. In the midst of
her passion, she also took an evil pleasure in tantalizing, merely for
tantalizing&rsquo;s sake: it gave her an exquisite enjoyment; it made
her husband jealous&mdash;perhaps for the first time, for she had
always been very careful&mdash;and made Theo and Doddie jealous; she
aroused the jealousy of every young married <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>woman and every girl; and, since she stood above
all of them, as the resident&rsquo;s wife, she had an ascendancy over
all of them. When of an evening she had gone too far, she delighted in
winning back, with a smile, with a gracious word, the place in their
affection which she had lost through her flirtations. And, strange
though it might seem, she succeeded. The moment they saw her, the
moment she spoke, smiled and exerted herself to be amiable, she won
back all she had lost and was forgiven everything. Even Mrs. Eldersma
allowed herself to be conquered by the strange charm of this woman who
was neither witty nor intelligent, who merely became just a little
livelier, who roused herself a little from her boring lethargy, who
triumphed only through the lines of her body, the contour of her face,
the glance of her strange eyes, restful and yet full of hidden passion,
and who was conscious of all her charm because she had meditated upon
it since her childhood. Together with her indifference, this charm
constituted her strength. Fate seemed to have no hold upon her. For it
had indeed touched her with a strange magic, until she thought that a
chastisement was about to descend upon her, but it had gone its way
again, drifted away. But she accepted the warning. She had done with
Theo and henceforth affected a motherly attitude towards him. It made
him furious, especially at these parties, now that she had grown
younger, livelier and more seductive.</p>
<p>His passion for her began to burn to hatred. He hated her now, with
all the instinct of a fair-haired native, for that was what he really
was, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>despite his white skin. For he was his
mother&rsquo;s son rather than his father&rsquo;s. Oh, he hated her
now, for he had felt his fear of the punishment only for an instant and
<i>he</i> &hellip; he had forgotten everything by now! And his one idea
was to injure her&mdash;how he did not yet know&mdash;but to injure her
so that she might feel pain and suffer. The process of thinking it over
imparted a Satanic gloom to his small, murky soul. Although he did not
think about it, he felt unconsciously that she was as though
invulnerable; he even felt that she boasted inwardly of her
invulnerability and that it made her daily more brazen and indifferent.
She was constantly staying at Patjaram, on any excuse that offered. The
anonymous letters which Van Oudijck still often showed her no longer
disturbed her; she was growing accustomed to them. She returned them to
him without a word; once she even forgot them, left them lying about in
the back-verandah. Once Theo read them. In a sudden flash of light, due
to he knew not what, suddenly he seemed to recognize certain
characters, certain strokes. He remembered, in the compound, near
Patjaram, the hut, half bamboo, half packing-case-boards, where he and
Addie de Luce had been to see Si-Oudijck and the papers hastily raked
together by an Arab. He had a vague recollection of seeing those same
characters, those strokes, on a scrap of paper on the floor. It passed
vaguely and quick as lightning through his head. But it was no more
than a lightning-flash. His small, murky soul had room for nothing but
dull hatred and troubled calculation. But he had not sense enough to
follow out that calculation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href=
"#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>He hated his father by instinct
and innate antipathy; his mother, because she was a half-caste; his
step-mother, because she had finished with him; he hated Addie and
Doddie into the bargain; he hated the world, because it made him work.
He hated every berth he had ever had: he now hated his office at
Surabaya. But he was too lazy and too muddle-headed to do harm. Rack
his brains as he might, he could not discover how to harm his father,
Addie and L&eacute;onie. Everything about him was vague, turbid,
dissatisfied, indistinct. The object of his desire was money and a fine
woman. Beyond this, he had nothing in him but the dull-witted gloom and
discontent of the fat, fair-haired Eurasian that he was. And he
continued to brood impotently over his murky thoughts.</p>
<p>Until now, Doddie had always been very fond of L&eacute;onie,
instinctively. But she was no longer able to conceal the fact from
herself: what she had first thought an accident&mdash;mamma and Addie
always seeking each other with the same smile of allurement, one
drawing the other the length of the great room, as though
irresistibly&mdash;was not an accident at all! And she too hated mamma
now, mamma with her beautiful calmness, her <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e3549" title="Source: soveran">sovereign</span> indifference. Her
own violent passionate nature was coming into collision with that other
nature, with its milk-white, creole languor, which now for the first
time, late in the day, because of the sheer kindliness of fate, was
letting itself go as it pleased, without reserve. She hated mamma; and
her hatred resulted in scenes, scenes of nervous, loud-voiced temper in
Doddie contrasting with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href=
"#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>the irritating calmness of
mamma&rsquo;s indifference, scenes caused by all sorts of little
differences of opinion: a visit, a ride on horse-back, a dress, a spice
or condiment which the one liked and the other did not. Then Doddie
wanted to have her cry out on papa&rsquo;s breast, but Van Oudijck
would not admit that she was in the right and said that she must show
more respect to mamma. But once, when Doddie had come to him for
consolation and he reproached her for going for walks with Addie, she
screamed out that mamma herself was in love with Addie. Van Oudijck
angrily ordered her out of the room. But it all agreed too
closely&mdash;the anonymous letters, his wife&rsquo;s new-born
flirtations, Doddie&rsquo;s accusations and what he himself had noticed
at the last few parties&mdash;not to give him food for reflection and
even to worry him. And, once he began to worry and reflect upon it all,
memories came suddenly darting into his mind like lightning-flashes:
memories of an unexpected visit; of a locked door; of a moving curtain;
of a whispered word and a timidly averted glance. He pieced it all
together and he quite suddenly recollected those same subtle memories
in combination with others, of an earlier date. It all at once aroused
his jealousy, a husband&rsquo;s jealousy of the wife whom he loves as
his most personal possession. This jealousy burst upon him like a gust
of wind, blowing its way through his concentration upon his work,
confusing his thoughts as he sat writing, making him suddenly run out
of his office, during the police-cases, and search
L&eacute;onie&rsquo;s room and lift a curtain and even look under the
bed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span></p>
<p>And now he no longer consented to have L&eacute;onie staying at
Patjaram, advancing as his pretext that the De Luces should not be
encouraged in the hope of getting Doddie as a wife for Addie. For he
dared not speak to L&eacute;onie of his jealousy&#8202;&hellip;. That
Addie should ever get Doddie for his wife!&hellip; True, there was
native blood in his daughter too; but he wanted a full-blooded European
as his son-in-law. He hated anything half-caste. He hated the De Luces
and all the up-country, Indian, half-Solo traditions of that Patjaram
of theirs. He hated their gambling, their hobnobbing with all sorts of
Indian headmen, people whom he accepted officially, allowing them their
rights, but, apart from this, regarded as unavoidable instruments of
the government policy. He hated all their posing as an old Indian
family and he hated Addie: an idle youth, who was supposed to be
employed in the factory but did nothing at all, except run after every
woman, girl and maid-servant in the place. He, the older, industrious
man, was unable to understand that kind of existence.</p>
<p>So L&eacute;onie had to do without Patjaram; but in the mornings she
went quietly to Mrs. van Does and met Addie in this lady&rsquo;s little
house while Mrs. van Does herself went out peddling, in a little cart,
with two jam-pots filled with diamonds and a bundle of embroidered
bedspreads. Then, in the evenings, Addie would stroll out with Doddie
and listen to her passionate reproaches. He laughed at her tempersome
displays, took her in his arms till she hung panting on his breast,
kissed the reproaches from her mouth till she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>melted away amorously on his lips. They went no
further, feeling too much afraid, especially Doddie. They strolled
behind the compounds, on the irrigation-dikes of the rice-fields, while
swarms of fire-flies whirled about them in the dark like tiny lanterns;
they strolled arm-in-arm, they walked hand-in-hand, in enervating,
caressing love, which never dared to push matters any further. When she
came home again, she was furious, raging at mamma, in whom she envied
the calm, smiling satiety as she lay musing, in her white tea-gown,
with a touch of powder on her face, in a cane chair.</p>
<p>And the house, newly painted and whitewashed after the strange
happenings, which were now past, the house was filled with a hatred
that rose on every hand, as it were the very demoniacal bloom of that
strange secret; a hatred <span class="corr" id="xd26e3563" title=
"Source: centring">centering</span> upon that silent woman, who was too
languid to hate and only delighted in silent tantalizing; a jealous
hatred of the father for the son, when he saw him too often sitting
beside his step-mother, begging, in spite of his own hatred, for
something, the father did not know what; a hatred of the daughter for
the mother; a hatred in which all this family-life was being wrecked.
How it had all gradually come about Van Oudijck did not know. He sadly
regretted the time when he was blind, when he had seen his wife and
children only in the light in which he wished to see them. That time
was past. Like the strange happenings of not so long ago, a hatred was
now rising out of life, like a miasma out of the ground. And Van
Oudijck, who had never been superstitious, who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>had
worked on coolly and calmly in his lonely house, with the
incomprehensible witchcraft all about him; who had read reports while
the hammering went on above his head and his whisky-and-soda changed
colour in his glass; Van Oudijck for the first time in his
life&mdash;now that he saw the gloomy glances of Theo and Doddie; now
that he suddenly discovered his wife, growing more brazen daily,
sitting hand-in-hand with young De Luce, her knees almost touching
his&mdash;became superstitious, believing in a hidden force which
lurked he knew not where, in India, in the soil of India, in a
deep-seated mystery, somewhere or other, a force that wished him ill
because he was a European, a ruler, a foreigner on the mystic, sacred
soil. And, when he saw this superstition within himself, something so
new to him, the practical man, something so strange and incredible to
him, a man of single-minded, masculine simplicity, he was afraid of
himself, as of a rising insanity which he began to perceive deep down
within himself.</p>
<p>And, strong though he had proved himself to be at the time of the
strange happenings, which he had been able to exorcize with a single
word of threatening force, this superstition, which came as an
aftermath of those events, found a weakness in him, a vulnerable spot
as it were. He was so much surprised at himself that he did not
understand and was afraid lest he might be going mad; and still he
worried. His health was undermined by an incipient liver-complaint; and
he kept on examining his jaundiced complexion. Suddenly he had an idea
that he was being poisoned. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268"
href="#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span>kitchen was searched, the
cook subjected to a cross-examination; but nothing came to light. He
realized that he had been frightened by nothing. But the doctor
declared that he had an enlarged liver and prescribed the usual diet. A
thing which otherwise he would have thought quite natural, a far from
uncommon illness, now of a sudden struck him as strange, a mysterious
event; and he worried over it. And it got on his nerves. He began to
suffer from sudden weariness when working, from throbbing headaches.
His jealousy upset him; he was overcome by a shuddering restlessness.
He suddenly reflected that, if there were now any hammering above his
head, if betel-juice were now spat at him, he would not be able to stay
in the house. And he began to believe in a hatred rising slowly all
around him out of the hostile soil, like a miasma. He believed in a
force deep-hidden in the things of India, in the nature of Java, in the
climate of Labuwangi, in the conjuring&mdash;as he continued to call
it&mdash;which sometimes makes the Javanese cleverer than the European
and gives him the power, a mysterious power, not to release himself
from the yoke, but to cause illness, lingering illness, to plague and
harass, to play the ghost most incredibly and hideously: a hidden
force, a hidden power, hostile to our temperament, our blood, our
bodies, our souls, our civilization, to all that seems to us the right
thing to do and be and think. It had flashed before him as in a sudden
light, it was not the result of thought, it had flashed out before him
as in a dreadful revelation, which was utterly in conflict with all the
logic of his methodical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href=
"#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>life, his methodical mode of
thought. In a vision of terror, he suddenly saw it before him, as the
light of his approaching old age, as men who are growing old do
sometimes suddenly perceive the truth. And yet he was young still and
hale. And he felt that, if he did not divert his maddening thoughts,
they might make him ill, weak and miserable, for ever and
ever&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>To him, above all, a simple, practical man, this change of mental
attitude was almost unbearable. What a morbid mind might have
contemplated in quiet meditation now flashed upon him as a sudden
terror. Never would he have thought that there might be somewhere,
deeply hidden in life, things which were stronger than the power of the
human will and intellect. Nowadays, after the nightmare which he had so
courageously defeated, it seemed to him that the nightmare had sapped
his strength nevertheless and inoculated him with every sort of
weakness. It was incredible, but now, as he sat working late in the
day, he would listen to the evening voices in the garden, or to the rat
that rustled overhead. And then he would suddenly get up, go to
L&eacute;onie&rsquo;s room and look under the bed. When he at last
discovered that many of the anonymous letters by which he was
persecuted came from the pen of a half-caste who described himself as
his son and was even known in the compound by his own surname, he felt
too doubtful to investigate the matter, because of what might come to
light that he had himself forgotten, dating from his controllership,
from the old days, at Ngadjiwa. He was doubtful now of things of which
he had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>once been certain and positive. Nowadays he was
no longer able so positively to order his recollections of that period
as to swear that he had not a son, begotten almost unconsciously in
those days. He did not clearly remember the housekeeper who had looked
after him before his first marriage. And he preferred to let the whole
business of the anonymous letters smoulder in the dusky shadows, rather
than stir it up and enquire into it. He even caused money to be sent to
the native who called himself his son, so that the fellow might not
abuse the name which he arrogated to himself and demand presents all
over the compound: chickens and rice and clothes, things which
Si-Oudijck exacted from ignorant villagers, whom he threatened with the
vague anger of his father the sahib, yonder at Labuwangi. In order that
there might be no more threats of this anger, Van Oudijck sent him
money. It was weak of him: he would never have done it in the old days.
But now he had an inclination to hush things up, to gloss over things,
to be less stern and severe and rather to mitigate anything unduly
strict by half-measures. Eldersma was sometimes amazed when he saw the
resident, who used to be so firm, hesitating, when he saw him yielding
in matters of business, in differences with crown tenants, as he had
never done before. And slack methods of work would gradually have found
their way automatically into the office, if Eldersma had not taken the
work out of Van Oudijck&rsquo;s hands and given himself even more to do
than he already had. It was generally stated that the resident was ill.
And, in fact, his skin was yellow; his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb271" href="#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>liver was painful;
the least thing set his nerves quivering. It unsettled the house, in
conjunction with Doddie&rsquo;s tempers and outbursts and Theo&rsquo;s
jealousy and hatred, for Theo was at home again, had already thrown up
Surabaya. L&eacute;onie alone continued her triumphant career, ever
beautiful, white, calm, smiling, contented, happy in the lasting
passion of Addie, whom she knew how to hold, amorous expert,
love&rsquo;s sorceress that she was. Fate had warned her and she kept
Theo at a distance; but for the rest she was happy and contented.</p>
<p>Then suddenly Batavia fell vacant. The names of two or three
residents were mentioned, but Van Oudijck had possessed the best
chance. And he worried about it, was afraid of it: he did not care for
Batavia as a residency. He would not have been able to work in Batavia
as he worked here, at Labuwangi, zealously and devotedly fostering so
many different interests connected with agriculture and the people. He
would rather have been appointed to Surabaya, where there was plenty
going on; or to one of the Vorstenlanden, where his tact in dealing
with the native princes would have been turned to good purpose. But
Batavia! It was the least interesting of all districts, from the
official point of view, and, what with the arrogant atmosphere of the
place, the least flattering to one in the position of resident, in
close contact with the governor-general, surrounded by the highest
officials, so that the resident, who was almost supreme anywhere else,
was at Batavia no more than yet another high official among so many
members of council and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href=
"#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>directors. And it was much too
near Buitenzorg, with its arbitrary secretariat, whose bureaucratic and
red-tape methods were always clashing with the practical administrative
methods of the residents themselves.</p>
<p>The prospect of being appointed unsettled him entirely, harassed him
more than ever, with the thought of leaving Labuwangi in a
month&rsquo;s time, of selling up his furniture. It would break his
heart to leave Labuwangi. In spite of all that he had gone through
there, he loved the town and especially his district. During all those
years, he had left traces of activity throughout his district, traces
of his devoted labour, of his ambition, of his affection. And now,
within a month, he would probably have to transfer all this to a
successor, to tear himself away from everything that he had so lovingly
cherished and fostered. It filled him with a sombre melancholy. He
cared not a straw for the fact that the promotion also brought him
nearer to his pension. That unoccupied future, with the boredom of
approaching old age, was a very nightmare to him. And his successor
would perhaps make all manner of changes, would disagree at every
single point.</p>
<p>In the end, the chance of his promotion became such a morbid
obsession with him that the improbable thing happened and he wrote to
the director of the B.B. and to the governor-general, begging to be
left at Labuwangi. The secret of these letters was pretty well kept: he
himself concealed them entirely, both from his family and from his
subordinates, so that, when a younger second-class resident was
appointed Resident of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href=
"#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>Batavia, people said that Van
Oudijck had been passed over, but not that this had happened at his own
request. And, in seeking the cause, they raked up all the old gossip
about the dismissal of the Regent of Ngadjiwa and the strange
happenings thereafter, but without finding in either any particular
reason why the government should have passed over Van Oudijck.</p>
<p>He himself recovered a strange sort of peace, a peace due to
weariness, to <i lang="fr">laisser-aller</i>, to becoming rooted in his
familiar Labuwangi, to not having to be transferred, old up-country
veteran that he was, to Batavia, where things were so very different.
When the governor-general, at his last audience, had spoken to him
about going to Europe on leave, he had felt afraid of Europe, afraid of
no longer feeling at home there; and now he felt afraid even of
Batavia. And yet he knew all that there was to know about the would-be
western humbug of Batavia; yet he knew that the capital of Java only
pretended to be exceedingly European and in reality was only
half-European. In himself&mdash;and unknown to his wife, who regretted
that dispelled illusion of Batavia&mdash;he chuckled silently at the
thought that he had succeeded in remaining at Labuwangi. But, while he
chuckled, he nevertheless felt changed, aged, belittled, felt that he
was no longer glancing at that upward path&mdash;the prospect of
constantly winning a higher place among his fellow-men&mdash;which had
always been his path of life. What had become of his ambition? What had
happened to decrease his love of authority? He put it all down to the
influence of the climate. It would certainly be a good <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>thing to refresh his blood and his mind in
Europe, to spend a couple of winters there. But the idea immediately
evaporated, wiped out by his lack of resolution. No, he did not want to
go to Europe; it was India that he loved. And he indulged in long
meditations, lying in a long-chair, enjoying his coffee, his light
clothing, the gentle relaxation of his muscles, the aimless drowsiness
of his thoughts. The only obvious thing in his drowsy mood was his
ever-increasing suspicion; and now and again he would suddenly wake
from his languor and listen to the vague sounds, the soft, suppressed
laughter which he seemed to hear in L&eacute;onie&rsquo;s room, even as
at night, when, suspicious of ghosts, he listened to the muffled sounds
in the garden and to the rat scurrying overhead. <span class=

<h2 class="main">Chapter Thirty</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">Addie was sitting with Mrs. van Does, in the
little back-verandah, when they heard a carriage rattle up in front of
the house. They smiled at each other and rose from their seats:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall leave you to yourselves,&rdquo; said Mrs. van
Does.</p>
<p>And she disappeared, to drive round the town in a dog-cart and do
business among her friends.</p>
<p>L&eacute;onie entered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Mrs. van Does?&rdquo; she asked, for she always
behaved as though it were the first time.</p>
<p>It was her great charm. He knew this and answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has just gone out. She will be sorry to have missed
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke like this because he knew that she liked it: the ceremonial
opening each time, to preserve above all things the freshness of their
<i>liaison</i>.</p>
<p>They now sat down in the little, shut-in middle gallery, side by
side on a settee.</p>
<p>The settee was covered with a cretonne displaying many-coloured
flowers; on the white walls were a few cheap fans and kakemonos; and on
either side of a little looking-glass stood a console-table with an
imitation bronze statue, two nondescript knights, each with one leg
advanced and a spear in his hand. Through the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>glass door the musty little back-verandah
showed, with its damp, yellow-green pillars, its flower-pots, also
yellow-green, with a few withered rose-trees; and behind this was the
damp, neglected little garden, with a couple of lean coco-palms,
hanging their leaves like broken feathers.</p>
<p>He now took her in his arms and drew her to him, but she pushed him
away gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doddie is becoming unbearable,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Something must be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must leave the house. She is so irritable that
there&rsquo;s no living with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tease her, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders; she had been put out by a recent scene
with her step-daughter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never used to tease her. She was fond of me and we got on
all right together. Now she flies out at the least thing. It&rsquo;s
your fault. Those everlasting evening walks, which lead to nothing,
upset her nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s just as well that they lead to
nothing,&rdquo; he murmured, with his little laugh, the laugh of the
tempter. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t break with her, you know: it would
make her unhappy. And I can&rsquo;t bear to make a woman
unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed scornfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re so good-natured. From sheer good-nature you
would scatter your favours broadcast. Anyway, she&rsquo;ll have to
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go? Where to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask such silly questions!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
angrily, roused out of her usual indifference. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have
to go, somewhere or other, I don&rsquo;t <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb277" href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>care where. You know,
when I say a thing, it&rsquo;s done. And this is going to be
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was now clasping her in his arms:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so angry. You&rsquo;re not a bit pretty like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her temper, she at first refused to let him kiss her: but, as he
did not like these tempers and was well aware of the irresistible power
of his comely, Moorish virility, he mastered her with rough, smiling
violence and held her so tight to him that she was unable to stir:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t be angry any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will. I hate Doddie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor girl has done you no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, it&rsquo;s you who tease her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because I hate her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Surely you&rsquo;re not jealous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! That&rsquo;s not one of my failings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it matter to you? I myself don&rsquo;t know. I hate
her. I love tormenting her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you as wicked as you are beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does wicked mean? I don&rsquo;t know or care! I should
like to torment you too, if I only knew how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I should like to give you a good smacking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She again gave a shrill laugh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it would do me good,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I
seldom lose my temper, but Doddie&#8202;&hellip;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She contracted her fingers and, suddenly calming <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>down, nestled against him and locked her arms
about his body:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to be very indifferent,&rdquo; she confessed.
&ldquo;Latterly I have been much more easily upset, after I had that
fright in the bathroom &hellip; after they spat at me so, with
betel-juice. Do you believe it was ghosts? I don&rsquo;t. It was some
practical joke of the regent&rsquo;s. Those beastly Javanese know all
sorts of things&#8202;&hellip;. But, since then, I have, so to speak,
lost my bearings. Do you understand that expression?&hellip; It used to
be delightful: I would let everything run off me like water off a
duck&rsquo;s back. But, after being so ill, I seem to have changed, to
be more nervous. Theo one day, when he was angry with me, said that
I&rsquo;ve been hysterical since then &hellip; and I never used to be.
I don&rsquo;t know: perhaps he&rsquo;s right. But I&rsquo;m certainly
changed&#8202;&hellip;. I don&rsquo;t care so much what people think or
say; I think I&rsquo;m growing quite shameless&#8202;&hellip;.
They&rsquo;re gossiping too more spitefully than they used
to&#8202;&hellip;. Van Oudijck irritates me, prying about as he does.
He&rsquo;s beginning to notice something&#8202;&hellip;. And Doddie!
Doddie!&hellip; I&rsquo;m not jealous, but I can&rsquo;t stand her
evening walks with you&#8202;&hellip;. You must give it up, do you
hear, walking with her! I won&rsquo;t have it, I won&rsquo;t have
it!&hellip; And then everything bores me in this place, at Labuwangi.
What a wretched, monotonous life!&hellip; Surabaya&rsquo;s a bore
too&#8202;&hellip;. So&rsquo;s Batavia&#8202;&hellip;. It&rsquo;s all
so dull and stodgy: people never think of anything new&#8202;&hellip;.
I should like to go to Paris. I believe I have it in me to enjoy Paris
thoroughly&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279"
href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I bore you too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stroked his face with her two hands and passed them over his
chest and down his thighs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think of you. You&rsquo;re a
pretty boy, but you&rsquo;re too good-natured. That irritates me too.
You kiss everybody who wants you to kiss them. At Patjaram, you are
always pawing everybody, including your old mother and your sisters. I
think it&rsquo;s horrid of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re growing jealous!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jealous? Am I really getting jealous? How horrid if I am! I
don&rsquo;t know: I don&rsquo;t think I am, all the same. I don&rsquo;t
want to be. After all, I believe there&rsquo;s something that will
always protect me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A devil&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly. <i lang="fr">Un bon diable.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you taking to speaking French?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. With a view to Paris&#8202;&hellip;. There&rsquo;s
something that protects me. I firmly believe that life can do me no
injury, that nothing can touch me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re becoming superstitious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was always that! Perhaps I&rsquo;ve become more
so&#8202;&hellip;. Tell me, have I changed, lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re touchier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so indifferent as I was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re livelier, more amusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Used I to be a bore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were a little quiet. You were always beautiful,
exquisite, divine &hellip; but rather quiet.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was because I minded people more then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not now. They gossip just the same&#8202;&hellip;. But
tell me; haven&rsquo;t I changed more than that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have: you&rsquo;re more jealous, more superstitious,
more touchy&#8202;&hellip;. What more do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Physically: haven&rsquo;t I changed physically?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I grown older?&hellip; Am I not getting
wrinkled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You? Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen. I believe I have still quite a future before me,
something very different&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&#8202;&hellip;. Tell me, am I not too old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Paris&#8202;&hellip;. How old do you think I
am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fibbing. You know perfectly well that I&rsquo;m
thirty-two. Do I look thirty-two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, don&rsquo;t you think India a horrible
country?&hellip; Have you never been to Europe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was there from ten to fifteen&#8202;&hellip;. Properly
speaking, you&rsquo;re a brown native and I a white
creole&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love my country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because you think yourself a bit of a Solo
prince&#8202;&hellip;. That&rsquo;s your Patjaram
nonsense&#8202;&hellip;. As for me, I hate India, I loathe Labuwangi. I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>want to get away. I want to go to
Paris&#8202;&hellip;. Will you come too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I should never want to go&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even when you reflect that there are hundreds of women in
Europe whom you have never loved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her: something in her words, in her voice, made him
glance up; a crazy hysteria, which had never struck him in the old
days, when she had always been the silently passionate mistress, with
half-closed eyes, who always wanted to forget everything at once and to
become conventional again. Something in her repelled him. He loved the
soft, pliant surrender of her caresses, the smiling indolence which she
used to display, but not these half-mad eyes and this purple mouth,
which seemed ready to bite. She seemed to feel this, for she suddenly
pushed him from her and said, brusquely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bore me&#8202;&hellip;. I know all there is to know in
you&#8202;&hellip;. Go away&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this he would not do. He did not care for futile
<i>rendez-vous</i> and he now embraced her and solicited
her&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, curtly. &ldquo;You bore me. Every one
bores me here. Everything bores me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He, on his knees, put his hands about her waist and drew her to him.
She, smiling a little, became slightly more yielding, rumpling his hair
nervously with her hand. A carriage pulled up in front of the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mrs. van Does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon she&rsquo;s back!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect she&rsquo;s sold nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;ll cost you a ten-guilder note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you pay her much &hellip; for allowing us to meet
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what does it matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she said again, more attentively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not Mrs. van Does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s footstep&#8202;&hellip;. It
wasn&rsquo;t a dog-cart either: it was much too noisy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Some one
who has mistaken the house. Nobody ever comes here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s going round,&rdquo; he said, listening.</p>
<p>They both listened for a moment. And then, suddenly, after two or
three strides through the cramped little garden and along the little
back-verandah, <i>his</i> figure, Van Oudijck&rsquo;s, appeared outside
the closed glass door, visible through the curtain. And he had pulled
it open before L&eacute;onie and Addie could change their position, so
that Van Oudijck saw them both, her sitting on the couch and him
kneeling before her, while her hand still lay, as though forgotten, on
his hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&eacute;onie!&rdquo; roared her husband.</p>
<p>Her blood under the shock of the surprise broke into stormy waves
and seethed through her veins and, in one second, she saw the whole
future: his anger, the trial, the divorce, her alimony, all in one
whirling vision. But, as though by the compulsion of her nervous will,
the tide of blood within her at once subsided and grew calm; and she
remained quietly sitting there, her terror <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>showing for but a moment longer in her eyes,
until she could turn them hard as steel upon Van Oudijck. And, by
pressing her finger softly on Addie&rsquo;s head, she suggested to him
also to remain in the same attitude, to remain kneeling at her feet,
and she said, as though self-hypnotized, listening in astonishment to
her own slightly husky voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Otto &hellip; Adrien de Luce is asking me to put in a word
with you for him&#8202;&hellip;. He is asking &hellip; for
Doddie&rsquo;s hand&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all three remained motionless, all three under the influence of
these words, of this thought which had come &hellip; whence
L&eacute;onie herself did not know. For, sitting rigid and erect as a
sibyl and still with that gentle pressure on Addie&rsquo;s head, she
repeated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is asking &hellip; for Doddie&rsquo;s
hand&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was still the only one to speak. And she continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows that you have certain objections. He knows that you
do not care for his family &hellip; because they have Javanese blood in
their arteries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was still speaking as though some one else were speaking inside
her; and she had to smile at that word arteries, she did not know why:
perhaps because it was the first time in her life that she had used the
word arteries, for veins, in conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;there are no financial
drawbacks, if Doddie likes to live at Patjaram&#8202;&hellip;. And the
children have been fond of each other &hellip; so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She alone was speaking still: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284"
href="#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Doddie has so long been overstrung, almost
ill&#8202;&hellip;. It would be a crime, Otto, not to
consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gradually her voice became more musical and the smile formed about
her lips; but the light in her eyes was still hard as steel, as though
she were threatening Van Oudijck with her anger if he refused to
believe her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, very gently, very kindly, patting
Addie&rsquo;s head softly with her trembling fingers. &ldquo;Get up
&hellip; Addie &hellip; and go &hellip; to &hellip; papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose, mechanically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&eacute;onie, what were you doing here?&rdquo; asked Van
Oudijck, hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here? I was with Mrs. van Does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he?&rdquo; pointing to Addie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He?&hellip; He happened to be calling&#8202;&hellip;. Mrs.
van Does had to go out&#8202;&hellip;. Then he asked leave to speak to
me&#8202;&hellip;. And then he asked me &hellip; for Doddie&rsquo;s
hand&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were again all three silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Otto?&rdquo; she now asked, more harshly.
&ldquo;What brought you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything you want to buy of Mrs. van Does?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theo told me you were here&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theo was right&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&eacute;onie&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose and, with her eyes hard as steel, she intimated to him that
he <i>must</i> believe her, that she <i>insisted</i> on his believing
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case, Otto,&rdquo; she said; and her manner
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>was once more gently kind, &ldquo;do not leave
Addie any longer in his uncertainty. And you, Addie, don&rsquo;t be
afraid &hellip; and ask papa for Doddie&rsquo;s hand&#8202;&hellip;. I
have nothing to say where Doddie is concerned &hellip; as I have often
told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They now all three stood facing one another, in the narrow middle
gallery; breathing with difficulty, oppressed by their accumulated
emotions. Then Addie said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resident, I ask you &hellip; for your daughter&rsquo;s
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dog-cart pulled up at the front of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mrs. van Does,&rdquo; said L&eacute;onie,
hurriedly. &ldquo;Otto, say something before she
comes&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consent,&rdquo; said Van Oudijck, gloomily.</p>
<p>He made off at the back before Mrs. van Does had entered and did not
see the hand which Addie held out to him. Mrs. van Does came in
trembling, following by a babu carrying her bundle, her merchandise.
She saw L&eacute;onie and Addie standing stiff and hypnotized:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the <i>resid&egrave;n&rsquo;s</i> chariot!&rdquo;
stammered the Indian lady, pale in the face. &ldquo;Was it the
<i>resid&egrave;n</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said L&eacute;onie, calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! And what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said L&eacute;onie, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or rather, something did happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addie and Doddie are &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Engaged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she shrieked the words with a shrill outburst <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>of
uncontrollable mirth at the comedy of life and took Mrs. van Does, who
stood with the eyes starting out of her head, and spun her round and
kicked the bundle out of the babu&rsquo;s hands, so that a parcel of
embroidered bedspreads and table-slips fell to the ground and a little
jam-pot full of glittering crystals rolled away and broke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&hellip; My brilliants!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One more kick of frolicsome wantonness; and the table-slips flew to
left and right and the diamonds lay glittering scattered among the legs
of the tables and chairs. Addie, his eyes still filled with terror,
crawled about on his hands and feet, raking them together.</p>
<p>Mrs. van Does repeated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Engaged!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">Doddie was rapt into the seventh heaven of
delight when Van Oudijck told her that Addie had asked her hand in
marriage; and, when she heard that mamma had been her advocate, she
embraced L&eacute;onie boisterously, with the emotional spontaneity of
her temperament, once more surrendering to the attraction which
L&eacute;onie had exercised upon her for years. Doddie now at once
forgot everything that had annoyed her in the excessive intimacy
between mamma and Addie, when he used to hang over her chair and
whisper to her. She had never believed what now and again she had
heard, because Addie had always assured her that it was not true. And
she was ever so happy that she was going to live with Addie, he and she
together, at Patjaram. For Patjaram was her ideal of what a home should
be. The big house, full of sons and daughters and children and animals,
on all of whom the same kindness and cordiality and boredom were
lavished, while behind those sons and daughters shone the halo of their
Solo descent: the big house built on to the sugar factory was to her
the ideal residence; and she felt akin with all its little traditions:
the spices, crushed and ground by a babu squatting behind her chair,
while she sat at lunch, represented to her the supreme indulgence of
the palate; the races at Ngadjiwa, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288"
href="#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>attended by the leisurely
dawdling procession of all those women, with the babus behind them,
carrying the handkerchief, the scent-bottle, the opera-glasses, were
her <i>non plus ultra</i> of elegance; she loved the old dowager
raden-aju; and she had given herself to Addie, entirely, without
reserve, from the first moment of seeing him, when she was a little
girl of thirteen and he a boy of eighteen. It was because of him that
she had resisted with all her energy whenever papa proposed to send her
to Europe, to boarding-school in Brussels; because of him she had never
cared for any place except Labuwangi, Ngadjiwa or Patjaram; because of
him she was prepared to live and die at Patjaram.</p>
<p>It was because of him that she had felt all her little jealousies,
when her girl-friends told her that he was in love with this one or
carrying on with that one; because of him she would always know those
jealousies great and small, her whole life long. He would be her life,
Patjaram her world, sugar her interest, because it was Addie&rsquo;s
interest. Because of him she would long for many children, very many
children, who would be really brown: not white, like papa and mamma and
Theo, but brown, because her own mother was brown; and she herself was
a delicate brown, while Addie was a beautiful bronze colour, a Moorish
brown; and, after the example set at Patjaram, her children, her
numerous children, would be brought up in the shadow of the factory, in
an atmosphere of sugar, with a view to their planting the fields, when
they grew up, and milling the sugar-cane and restoring the fortunes of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>family to their former brilliancy. And she was
as happy as a girl in love could imagine herself to be, seeing her
ideal, Addie and Patjaram, so closely attainable and not for a second
realizing how her happiness had come about, through the word which
L&eacute;onie, almost unconsciously, had uttered, as though by
autosuggestion, at the supreme moment. Oh, now she need no longer seek
the dark corners, the dark rice-fields with Addie; now she was
constantly kissing him in broad daylight, leaning radiantly against
him, feeling his warm, virile body, which was hers and would soon be
hers entirely; now her eyes yearned up to him, for all to see, for she
no longer had the maidenly power of hiding her feelings from others;
now he was hers, hers, hers!</p>
<p>And he, with the good-natured surrender of a young sultan, suffered
her to caress his shoulders and knees, suffered her to kiss him and
stroke his hair, suffered her arm around his neck, accepting it all as
a tribute due to him, accustomed as he was to that feminine tribute of
love, he who had been fondled and caressed from the time when he was a
little, chubby boy, from the time when he was carried by Tidjem, his
babu, who was in love with him, from the time when he used to romp, in
his little pyjamas, with little sisters and cousins, all of whom were
in love with him. All this tribute he accepted good-naturedly, though
secretly surprised and shocked by what L&eacute;onie had
done&#8202;&hellip;. And yet, he argued, it would perhaps anyhow have
happened of itself, some day, because Doddie was so fond of him. He
would rather have remained unmarried: though <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>unmarried, he nevertheless had all the home life
at Patjaram that he wanted and retained his liberty to bestow abundant
love upon women, in his good-natured way. And he was already
ingenuously reflecting that it would not do, that it would never do to
remain faithful to Doddie long, because he was really too good-natured
and the women were all so crazy. Doddie must get used to it later on,
must learn to accept it; and, he reflected, after all, in Solo, in the
palace, it was the same thing, with his uncles and
cousins&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Had Van Oudijck believed what L&eacute;onie said? He himself did not
know whether he did or not. Doddie had accused L&eacute;onie of being
in love with Addie; Theo, that morning, when Van Oudijck asked him
where L&eacute;onie was, had answered, curtly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Mrs. van Does&rsquo; &hellip; with Addie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had glared at his son, but asked no further questions; he had
merely driven straight to Mrs. van Does&rsquo; house. And he had
actually found his wife with young de Luce, found him on his knees
before her; but she had said so quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adrian de Luce is asking me for your daughter&rsquo;s
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, he himself did not know whether he believed her or not. His wife
had answered so quietly; and now, during the first few days of the
engagement, she was so calm, smiling just as usual&#8202;&hellip;. He
now for the first time saw that strange side of her, that
invulnerability, as though nothing could harm her. Did he suspect,
behind this wall of invulnerability, the ironical feminine secrecy of
her silently smouldering inner life? It <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb291" href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>was as though, with
his recent nervous suspicion, with his restless mood, in the rankness
of superstition that led him to pry and listen to the haunting silence,
he had learnt to see around him things to which he had been blind in
his burly strength as a ruler and high and mighty chief official. And
his longing to make certain of the mysteries at which he was guessing
became so violent, in his morbid irritability, that he grew more
pleasant and kinder to his son, though this time it arose not from the
spontaneous paternal affection which, when all was said, he had always
felt for Theo, but from curiosity, to hear all that he had to say, to
make Theo speak out. And Theo, who hated L&eacute;onie, who hated his
father, who hated Addie, who hated Doddie, in his general hatred of all
those about him, who hated life with the stubborn ideas of a
fair-haired Eurasian, longing for money and beautiful women, angry
because the world, life, riches, happiness&mdash;as he pictured it to
himself in his petty fashion&mdash;did not come rushing to him, falling
into his arms, falling on his neck: Theo was willing enough to squeeze
out his words drop by drop, like gall and wormwood, silently revelling
in the sight of his father&rsquo;s suffering. And he allowed Van
Oudijck to divine, very gradually, that it was true, after all, about
mamma and Addie.</p>
<p>In the intimacy that sprang up between the father and son out of
suspicion and hatred, Theo spoke of his brother in the compound, said
that he knew papa sent him money and therefore acknowledged that the
thing was true. And Van Oudijck, no longer certain, no longer knowing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>the truth, admitted that it might be so,
admitted that it was so. Then, remembering the anonymous
letters&mdash;which had only lately ceased, since he had been sending
money to that half-caste who ventured to assume his name&mdash;he also
remembered the libels which he had often read in them and which, at the
time, he had always cast from him as so much filth; he remembered the
two names, those of his wife and of Theo himself, which had so
constantly been coupled in them. His distrust and suspicion blazed up
like flames, like a now inextinguishable fire, which scorched every
other thought or feeling &hellip; until at last he was no longer able
to restrain himself and spoke roundly to Theo on the subject. He did
not trust Theo&rsquo;s indignation and denial. And he now trusted
nothing and nobody, he distrusted his wife and his children and his
officials; he distrusted his cook&#8202;&hellip;. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first dropcap">Then, like a clap of thunder, the rumour ran
through Labuwangi that Van Oudijck and his wife were going to be
divorced. L&eacute;onie went to Europe, very suddenly, really without
any one&rsquo;s knowing why and without taking leave of anybody. And it
caused a great scandal in the little town: people talked of nothing
else and talked of it even as far away as Surabaya, as far away as
Batavia. Van Oudijck alone was silent; and, with his back a little more
bowed, went his way, working on, leading his ordinary life. He had
abandoned his principles and assisted Theo to obtain a job, in order to
be rid of him. He preferred to have Doddie staying at Patjaram, where
the De Luce women would help her with her trousseau. He preferred
Doddie to get married quickly and to get married at Patjaram. In his
great, empty house he now longed for nothing but solitude, a spacious,
cheerless solitude. He would no longer have the table laid for him:
they brought him a plateful of rice and a cup of coffee in his office.
And he felt ill, his zeal lessened; a dull indifference gnawed at his
vitals. He delegated all the work, all the district to Eldersma; and,
when Eldersma, after not sleeping for weeks, half-crazy with nervous
strain, told the resident that the doctor wanted to send him to Europe
with a certificate of urgency, Van Oudijck lost <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>all
his courage. He said that he too felt ill and done for. And he applied
to the governor-general for leave and went to Batavia. He said nothing
about it, but he felt certain that he would never return to Labuwangi.
And he went away, quietly, with not a glance at what he was leaving
behind him, at his great field of activity, which he had so lovingly
organized. The administration remained in the hands of the
assistant-resident at Ngadjiwa. It was generally believed that Van
Oudijck wished to see the governor-general about certain questions of
importance, but suddenly the news arrived that he was proposing to
retire. It was not credited at first, but the report was confirmed. Van
Oudijck did not return.</p>
<p>He had gone, without casting a glance behind him, in a strange
indifference, an indifference which had gradually corroded the very
marrow of this once so robust and practical man, who had always
remained young in his capacity for work. He felt this indifference for
Labuwangi, which, when there was a question of his promotion to
resident of the first class, he had thought himself incapable of
leaving except with the greatest regret; he felt this indifference for
his domestic circle, which no longer existed. His soul was filled with
a gradual blight; it was withering, dying. It seemed to him that all
his powers were melting away in the tepid stagnation of this
indifference. At Batavia he vegetated for a while in his hotel; and it
was generally assumed that he would go to Europe.</p>
<p>Eldersma had already gone, sick almost unto death; and Eva had been
unable to accompany <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295"
name="pb295">295</a>]</span>him, with the little boy, because she was
down with a bad attack of malarial fever. When she was more or less
convalescent, she sold up her house, with a view to going to Batavia
and staying there for three weeks with friends before her boat sailed.
She left Labuwangi with mixed feelings. She had suffered much there,
but had also reflected much; and she had cherished a deep feeling for
Van Helderen, a pure, radiant feeling such as could, she was sure,
shine forth only once in a lifetime. She took leave of him as of an
ordinary friend, in the presence of others, and gave him no more than a
pressure of the hand. But she felt so profoundly sad because of that
pressure of the hand, that commonplace farewell, that the sobs rose in
her throat. That evening, left to herself, she did not weep, but sat in
her room at the hotel, staring for hours silently before her. Her
husband was gone, was ill: she did not know how he would be when she
saw him, whether indeed she would ever see him again. Europe, it was
true, after her years in India, stretched its shores smilingly before
her, held forth the vision of its cities, its culture, its art; but she
was afraid of Europe. An unspoken fear lest she should have lost ground
intellectually made her almost dread the circle in her parents&rsquo;
house, to which she would have returned in a month&rsquo;s time. She
trembled at the thought that people would consider her colonial in her
manners and ideas, in her speech and dress, in the education of her
child; and this made her feel shy in anticipation, despite all her pose
as a smart, artistic woman. Certainly she no longer played the piano as
well as she did; she would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href=
"#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>not dare to play at the Hague. And
she thought that it might be a good thing to stay in Paris for a
fortnight and brush off her cobwebs a little, before showing herself in
the Hague&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>But Eldersma was too ill&#8202;&hellip;. And how would she find him,
her husband, so much changed, her once robust Frisian husband, now
tired out, worn out, yellow as parchment, careless of his appearance,
muttering gloomily when he spoke?&hellip; But a gentle vision of a
refreshing German landscape, of Swiss snows, of music at Bayreuth, of
art in Italy dawned before her staring gaze; and she was herself
reunited to her sick husband. No longer united in life, but united
under the yoke of life, the yoke which they had shouldered together,
once and for all&#8202;&hellip;. Then there was the education of her
child! Oh, to save her child, to get him away from India! And yet he,
Van Helderen, had never been out of India. But then he was himself, he
was an exception&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>She had bidden him good-bye&#8202;&hellip;. She must make up her
mind to forget him&#8202;&hellip;. Europe was waiting for her &hellip;
with her husband &hellip; and her child&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Two days later she was at Batavia. She hardly knew the city; she had
been there once or twice, years ago, when she first came out. At
Labuwangi, in that little, outlying district, Batavia had gradually
become glorified in her imagination into an essentially Eurasian
capital, a centre of Eurasian civilization, a dim vision of stately
avenues and squares, surrounded by great, wealthy, porticoed villas,
thronged with smart carriages <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297"
href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>and horses. She had always
heard so much about Batavia&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>She was now staying with friends. The husband was at the head of a
big commercial firm; their house was one of the handsomest villas on
the Koningsplein. And she had at once been very strangely impressed by
the funereal character, by the deadly melancholy of this great town of
villas, where thousands of varied lives are waging a silent, feverish
battle for a future of moneyed repose. It was as though all those
houses, gloomy despite their white pillars and their grand fronts, were
frowning like faces careworn with troubles that sought to hide
themselves behind a pretentious display of broad leaves and clustering
palms. The houses, however much exposed, amidst their pillars, however
seemingly open, remained closed; the occupants were never seen. Only in
the mornings, as she went on her errands along the shops in Rijswijk
and Molenvliet, which, with a few French names among them, tried to
give the impression of a southern shopping-centre, of European luxury,
Eva would see the exodus to the Old Town of the white men, white-faced,
dressed in white; and even their eyes seemed pale with brooding
anxieties, fixed upon a future which they all calculated in so many
decades or lustres: so much made, in this year or that; and then away,
away home from India to Europe. It was as though it were not malaria
that was undermining them, but another fever; and she felt clearly that
it was undermining their unacclimatized constitutions, their souls, as
though they were trying to skip that day and reach the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>to-morrow, or the day after, days which brought
them a little nearer to their goal, because they secretly feared to die
before that goal was attained. The exodus filled the trams with its
white burden of mortality. Many, already well off, but not yet rich
enough for their purpose, drove in their victorias or buggies to the
Harmonie Club and there took the tram, to spare their horses.</p>
<p>And in the Old Town, in the old, aristocratic houses of the first
Dutch merchants, still built in the Dutch style, with oak staircases
leading to upper floors which now, during the eastern monsoon, were
stagnant with a dense, oppressive heat, like a tangible element, which
stifled the breath, the white men bent over their work, constantly
beholding between their thirsty glance and the white desert of their
papers the dawning mirage of the future, the refreshing oasis of their
materialistic illusion: within such and such a time, money and then off
&hellip; off &hellip; to Europe&#8202;&hellip;. And, in the city of
villas, around the Koningsplein, along the green avenues, the women hid
themselves, the women remained unseen, the whole livelong day. The hot
day passed, the time of beneficent coolness came, the time from
half-past five to seven. The men returned home dog-tired and sat down
to rest; and the women, tired with their housekeeping, with their
children and with nothing at all, with a life of doing nothing, a life
without any interest, tired with the deadliness of their existence,
rested beside the men. That hour of beneficent coolness meant rest,
rest after the bath, in undress, around the tea-table, a short,
momentary rest, for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href=
"#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>fearsome hour of seven was at
hand, when it was already dark, when one had to go to a reception. A
reception implied dressing in stuffy European clothes, implied a brief
but dreadful display of European drawing-room manners and social
graces, but it also implied meeting this person and that and striving
to achieve yet one advance towards the mirage of the future: money and
ultimate rest in Europe. And, after the town of villas had lain in the
sun all day, gloomy and wan, like a dead city&mdash;with the men away
in the Old Town and the women hidden in their houses&mdash;a few
carriages now passed one another in the dark, round the Koningsplein
and along the green avenues, a few European-looking people, going to a
reception. While, around the Koningsplein and in the green avenues, all
the other villas persisted in this funereal desolation and remained
filled with gloomy darkness, the house where the party was given shone
with lamps among the palm-trees. And for the rest the deadliness
lingered on every hand, the sombre brooding lay over the houses wherein
the tired people were hiding, the men exhausted with work, the women
exhausted with doing nothing&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like a drive, Eva?&rdquo; asked her
hostess, Mrs. De Harteman, a little Dutchwoman, white as wax and always
tired out by her children. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d rather not come with
you, if you don&rsquo;t mind: I&rsquo;d rather wait for Harteman. Else
he&rsquo;d find nobody at home. So you go, with your little
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Eva, with her little man, went driving in the De Hartemans&rsquo;
&ldquo;chariot.&rdquo; It was the cool <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb300" href="#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span>hour of the day,
before darkness set in. She met two or three carriages: Mrs. This and
Mrs. That, who were known to drive in the afternoon. In the
Koningsplein she saw a lady and gentleman walking: the So-and-Sos; they
always walked, as all Batavia knew. She met no one else. No one. At
that beneficent hour, the villa-town remained desolate as a city of the
dead, as a vast mausoleum amid green trees. And yet it was a boon,
after the overwhelming heat, to see the Koningsplein stretching like a
gigantic meadow, where the parched grass was turning green with the
first rains, while the houses showed so far away, so very far away, in
their hedged-in gardens, that it was like being in the country, amid
wood and fields and pastures, with the wide sky overhead, from which
the lungs now breathed in air, as though for the first time that day,
breathed in oxygen and life: that wide sky, displaying every day as it
were a varying wealth of colours, an excess of sunset fires, a glorious
death of the scorching day, as though the sun itself were bursting into
torrents of gold between the lilac-hued and threatening rain-clouds.
And it was so spacious and so delightful, it was such an immense boon
that it actually made up for the day.</p>
<p>But there was no one to see it except the two or three people who
were known in Batavia to go driving or walking. A violet twilight rose;
then the night fell with one deep shadow; and the town, which had been
deathlike all day, with its frown of brooding gloom, dropped wearily
asleep, like a city of care&#8202;&hellip;. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span></p>
<p>It used to be different, said old Mrs. De Harteman, the
mother-in-law of Eva&rsquo;s friend. They were gone nowadays, the
pleasant houses with their Indian hospitality, their open tables, their
sincere and cordial welcomes, as if the colonist&rsquo;s character had
in some sense altered, had in some way been overcast by the
vicissitudes of chance, by his disappointment at not speedily achieving
his aim, his material aim of wealth. And, he being thus embittered, it
seemed that his nerves became irritable, just as his soul became
overcast and gloomy and his body lethargic and unable to withstand the
destructive climate&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And Eva did not find Batavia the ideal city of Eurasian civilization
which she had pictured it at Labuwangi. In this great money-grubbing
centre, every trace of spontaneity had vanished and life became
degraded to an everlasting seclusion in the office or at home. People
never saw each other save at receptions; any other conversation took
place over the telephone.</p>
<p>The abuse of the telephone for domestic purposes killed all
agreeable intimacy among friends. People no longer saw one another;
they no longer had any need to dress and send for the carriage, the
&ldquo;chariot&rdquo;; for they chatted over the telephone, in sarong
and kabaai, in pyjamas, almost without stirring a limb. The telephone
was close at hand and the bell was constantly ringing in the
back-verandah. People rang one another up for nothing, for the mere fun
of ringing up. Young Mrs. De Harteman had an intimate friend, a young
woman whom she never saw and to whom she telephoned daily, for half an
hour at a time. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302"
name="pb302">302</a>]</span>She sat down to it, so it did not tire her.
And she laughed and joked with her friend, without having to dress and
without moving. She did the same with other friends: she paid her
visits by telephone. She did her shopping by telephone. Eva had not
been accustomed at Labuwangi to this everlasting tinkling and ringing
up, which killed all conversation and, in the back-verandah, revealed
one half of a dialogue&mdash;the replies being inaudible to any one
sitting away from the instrument&mdash;in the form of an incessant,
one-sided jabbering. It got on her nerves and drove her to her room.
And, amid the boredom of this life, full of care and inward brooding
for the husband and penetrated by the chatter of the wife&rsquo;s
telephonic conversations, Eva would be surprised suddenly to hear of a
special excitement: a fancy-fair and the rehearsals of an amateur
operatic performance.</p>
<p>She herself attended one of these rehearsals during her visit and
was astonished by the really first-rate execution, as though those
musical amateurs had put the strength of despair into it, to dispel the
tedium of the Batavian evenings. For the Italian opera had left; and
she had to laugh at the heading &ldquo;Amusements&rdquo; in the
<i lang="nl">Javabode</i>, which amusements as a rule were limited to a
choice of three or four meetings of shareholders. This too used to be
different, said old Mrs. De Harteman, who remembered the excellent
French opera of twenty-five years ago, which, it was true, cost
thousands, but for which the thousands were always forthcoming. No,
people no longer had the money to amuse themselves <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>at
night. They sometimes gave a very expensive dinner, or else went to a
meeting of shareholders. Eva, in truth, considered Labuwangi a much
livelier place. True, she herself had largely contributed to the
liveliness, at the instigation of Van Oudijck, who was glad to make the
capital of his district a pleasant, cheerful little town. And she came
to the conclusion that, after all, she preferred a small, up-country
place, with a few cultured, agreeable European
inhabitants&mdash;provided that they harmonized with one another and
did not quarrel overmuch in the intimacy of their common life&mdash;to
this pretentious, pompous, dreary Batavia. The only life was among the
military element. Only the officers&rsquo; houses were lit up in the
evening. Apart from this, the town lay as though moribund, the whole
long, hot day, with its frown of care, with its invisible population of
people looking towards the future: a future of money, a future perhaps
even more of rest, in Europe.</p>
<p>And she longed to get away. Batavia suffocated her, notwithstanding
her daily drive round the spacious Koningsplein. She had only one wish
left, a melancholy wish: to say good-bye to Van Oudijck. Her peculiar
temperament, that of a smart, artistic woman, had, very strangely,
appreciated and felt the fascination of his character, that of a
simple, practical man. She had perhaps, only for a moment, felt
something for him, deep down within herself, a friendship which formed
a sort of contrast with her friendship for Van Helderen, an
appreciation of his fine human qualities rather than a feeling of
Platonic community <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304"
name="pb304">304</a>]</span>of souls. She had felt a sympathetic pity
for him in those strange, mysterious days, for the man living alone in
his enormous house, with the strange happenings creeping in upon him.
She had felt intensely sorry for him when his wife, kicking aside her
exalted position, had gone away in an insolent mood, arousing a storm
of scandal, nobody knew exactly why: his wife, at one time always so
correct in her demeanour, notwithstanding all her depravity, but
gradually devoured by the canker of the strange happenings until she
was no longer able to restrain herself, baring the innermost secrets of
her profligate soul with cynical indifference. The red betel-slaver,
spat as it were by ghosts on her naked body, had affected her like a
sickness, had eaten into the marrow of her bones, like a disintegration
of her soul, of which she might perhaps die, slowly wasting away. What
people now said of her, of her mode of life in Paris, represented
something so unutterably depraved that it was not to be mentioned above
a whisper.</p>
<p>Eva heard about it at Batavia, amid the gossip at the
evening-parties. And, when she asked after Van Oudijck&mdash;where he
was staying, whether he would soon be going to Europe, after his
unexpected resignation, a thing that had surprised the whole official
world&mdash;they were unable to tell her, they asked one another if he
was no longer at the H&ocirc;tel Wisse, where he had been seen only a
few weeks ago, lying on his chair in his little verandah, with his legs
on the rests, staring fixedly before him without moving a limb. He had
hardly gone out at all, taking his meals in his room <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span>and
not at the <i lang="fr">table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>, as though
he&mdash;the man who had always been accustomed to dealing with
hundreds of people&mdash;had became shy of meeting his
fellow-creatures. And at last Eva heard that Van Oudijck was living at
Bandong. As she had to pay some farewell visits, she went to the
Preanger. But he was not to be found at Bandong: all that the
hotel-proprietor was able to tell her was that Van Oudijck had stayed a
few days at his place, but had since gone, he did not know whither.</p>
<p>Then at last, by accident, she heard from a man whom she met at
dinner that Van Oudijck was living near Garut. She went to Garut,
feeling pleased to be on his track. The people in the hotel were able
to direct her to where he lived. She could not decide whether she
should first write to him and announce her visit. Something seemed to
warn her that, if she did, he would make some excuse and that she would
not see him. And she, now that she was on the point of leaving Java for
good, wanted to see him, from motives of mingled affection and
curiosity. She wished to see for herself how he looked, to get out of
him why he had so suddenly sent in his resignation and thrown up his
enviable position in life, a position instantly seized by the next man
after him, in the great push for promotion.</p>
<p>So, next morning, very early, without sending him word, she drove
away in a carriage belonging to the hotel. The landlord had explained
to the coachman where he was to go. And she drove a very long way,
along Lake Lell&egrave;s, the sombre sacred lake with the two islands
containing the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>age-old tombs of saints, while above it hovered,
like a dark cloud of desolation, an ever-circling flock of enormous
black bats, flapping their demon wings and screeching their cry of
despair, wheeling round and round incessantly: a black, funereal swirl
against the infinite blue depths of the ether, as though they, the
demons who had once dreaded light, had triumphed and no longer feared
the day, because they obscured it with the shadow of their sombre
flight. And it was all so oppressive: the sacred lake, the sacred tombs
and above them a horde as of black devils in the deep blue ether,
because it was as though a part of the mystery of India were being
suddenly revealed, no longer hiding itself, a vague, impalpable
presence, but actually visible in the sunlight, rousing dismay with its
menacing victory&#8202;&hellip;. Eva shuddered; and, as she glanced up
timidly, she felt as though the black multitude of screening wings
might beat down &hellip; upon her&#8202;&hellip;. But the shadow of
death between her and the sun only whirled dizzily around, high above
her head, and only uttered its despondent cry of
triumph&#8202;&hellip;. She drove on; and the plain of Lell&egrave;s
lay green and smiling before her. And that second of revelation had
already ticked past: there was nothing now but the green and blue
luxuriance of the Javanese landscape; the mystery was already hidden
away among the delicate, waving bamboos or merged in the azure ocean of
the sky.</p>
<p>The coachman was driving slowly up a steep hill. The liquid
rice-fields rose in terraces like stairs of looking-glass, pale-green
with carefully-planted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href=
"#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>blades of paddy; then, suddenly,
there came as who should say an avenue of ferns: gigantic ferns, waving
their fans on high, with great fabulous butterflies fluttering around
them. And between the diaphanous foliage of the bamboos there appeared
a small house, built half of stone, half of wattled bamboo, surrounded
by a little garden containing a few white pots of roses. A very young
woman in sarong and kabaai, with cheeks gleaming like pale gold and
coal-black eyes inquisitively peeping, looked out in surprise at the
carriage, which was approaching very slowly, and fled indoors. Eva
alighted and coughed. And she suddenly caught a glimpse of Van
Oudijck&rsquo;s face, peering round a screen in the middle gallery. He
disappeared at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resident!&rdquo; she cried, in a coaxing tone.</p>
<p>But no one appeared and she grew confused. She dared not sit down
and yet she did not want to go away. But round the corner of the house,
outside, there peeped a little face, two little brown faces, the faces
of very young half-caste girls, and vanished again, giggling. Inside
the house, Eva heard a greatly excited, very nervous whispering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sidin! Sidin!&rdquo; she heard somebody call, in a
whisper.</p>
<p>She smiled, took courage and stayed and walked about in the little
front-verandah. And at last there came an old woman, not perhaps so
very old in years, but old in wrinkled skin and eyes that had grown
dim, wearing a coloured chintz sabaai and dragging her slippers; and,
beginning with a few words of Dutch and then taking refuge in Malay,
smiling politely, she requested Eva to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb308" href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>be seated and said
that the resident would be there at once. She herself sat down, smiled,
did not know what to talk about, did not know what to answer when Eva
asked her about the lake, about the road. All that she could do was to
fetch syrup and iced-water and wafers; and she did not talk, but only
smiled and looked after her visitor. When the young half-caste faces
peeped round the corner, the old woman angrily stamped her slippered
foot and scolded them with a hasty word; and then they disappeared,
giggling and running away with an audible patter of little bare feet.
Then the old woman smiled again with her eternally smiling wrinkled
face and looked at the lady timidly, as though apologizing. And it was
a very long time before Van Oudijck at last entered the room.</p>
<p>He welcomed Eva effusively, excused himself for keeping her waiting.
It was obvious that he had shaved in a hurry and put on a clean white
suit. And he was evidently glad to see her. The old woman departed,
with her eternal smile of apology. In that first cheerful moment, Van
Oudijck seemed to Eva exactly the same as usual; but, when he had
calmed down and taken a chair and asked her whether she had heard from
Eldersma and when she herself was going to Europe, she saw that he had
grown older, an old man. It did not show in his figure, which, in his
well-starched white suit, still preserved its broad, soldierly air, a
sturdy build, with only the back a little more bowed, as though under a
burden. But it showed in his face, in the dull, uninterested glance, in
the deep furrows of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href=
"#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>careworn forehead, in the colour
of his skin, which was dry and yellow, while the thick moustache, about
which the jovial smile still flickered at intervals, had turned quite
grey. His hands shook nervously. And, when she told him what people had
said at Labuwangi, he listened without interrupting, betraying a
lingering curiosity about the people yonder, about the district of
which he had once been so fond. She discussed it all vaguely, glossing
over things, putting the best face on them and, above all, saying
nothing of the gossip: that he had taken French leave, that he had run
away, nobody quite knew why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, resident,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;are you going to
Europe too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared in front of him and gave a painful laugh before replying.
And at last he said, almost shyly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mevrouwtje. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll go home. You
see, I&rsquo;ve been somebody out here, in India; I&rsquo;d be nobody
over there. I&rsquo;m nobody now, I know; but still I feel that India
has become my country. It has got the upper hand of me; and I belong to
it now. I no longer belong to Holland, and I have nothing and nobody in
Holland that belongs to me. I&rsquo;m finished, it&rsquo;s true; but
still I&rsquo;d rather drag out my existence here than there. In
Holland I should certainly not be able to stand the climate &hellip; or
the people. Here the climate suits me and I have withdrawn from
society. I have helped Theo for the last time; and Doddie is married.
And the two boys are going to Europe, to
school&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suddenly bent towards her and, in a changed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>voice, he almost whispered, as though about to
make a confession:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, if everything had gone normally, then &hellip; then
I should not have acted as I did. I have always been a practical man
and I was proud of it and proud of living the normal life, my own life,
which I lived in accordance with principles that I thought were right,
until I reached a high place among my fellow-men. I have always been
like that and things went well like that. Everything went swimmingly
with me. When others were worrying about their promotion, I passed over
the heads of five men at a bound. It was all plain sailing for me, at
least in my official career. I have not been lucky in my domestic life,
but I should never have been weak enough to break down on the road with
grief because of that. A man has so much outside his domestic life. And
yet I was always very fond of my family-circle. I don&rsquo;t think it
was my fault that everything went as it did. I loved my wife, I loved
my children, I loved my home, my home surroundings, in which I was the
husband, and father. But that feeling in me was never fully satisfied.
My first wife was a half-caste whom I married because I was in love
with her. Because she could not get the upper hand of me with her
whim-whams, things became impossible after a few years. I was perhaps
even more in love with my second wife than with my first: I am simply
constituted in these matters. But I was never allowed to have a
pleasant home-circle, a pleasant, kindly wife, children climbing on
your knees and growing up into men and women who owe their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>lives to you, their existence, in short,
everything that they have and possess. That is what I should have liked
to have. But, as I say, though I did not get it, that would never have
pulled me under&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment and then continued in an even more
mysterious whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>that</i>, you see, the thing that
happened&#8202;&hellip;. I never understood; and it&rsquo;s <i>that</i>
which brought me to where I am. That &hellip; all that &hellip; which
clashed and interfered with my practical, logical ideas of life
&hellip; all that&rdquo;&mdash;he struck the table with his
fist&mdash;&ldquo;all that <i>damned nonsense</i>, which &hellip; which
happened all the same: <i>that</i> did the trick. I did not shirk the
fight, but my strength was no use to me. It was something against which
nothing availed&#8202;&hellip;. I know: it was the regent. When I
threatened him it stopped&#8202;&hellip;. But, my God, mevrouwtje, tell
me, <i>what</i> was it? Do you know? You don&rsquo;t, do you? Nobody
knew and nobody knows. Those terrible nights, those inexplicable noises
over head, that night in the bathroom with the major and the other
officers! It wasn&rsquo;t any hallucination: we saw it, we heard it, we
felt it, it spat at us, it covered us from head to foot; the whole
bathroom was full of it! It is easy for other people, who didn&rsquo;t
experience it, to deny it. But I &hellip; and all of us &hellip; we saw
it, heard it and felt it! And we none of us knew who it
was&#8202;&hellip;. And since then I have never ceased to feel it. It
was all around me, in the air, under my feet&#8202;&hellip;. You
see,&rdquo; he whispered very softly, &ldquo;<i>that</i>&mdash;and that
alone&mdash;did it. <i>That</i> made it impossible for me to stay
there. <i>That</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312"
name="pb312">312</a>]</span>caused me to be struck stupid, to become a
sort of idiot in the midst of my normal life, in the midst of my
practical good sense and logic, which suddenly appeared to me in the
light of an ill-constructed theory of life, of the most abstract
speculation, because, right through it, things were happening that
belonged to another world, things that escaped me and everybody else.
That, that alone, did it! I was no longer myself. I no longer knew what
I was thinking, what I was doing, what I had done. Everything in me was
tottering. That ruffian in the compound is no child of mine: I&rsquo;ll
stake my life on it. And I &hellip; I believed it. I sent him money.
Tell me, do you understand me? I don&rsquo;t suppose you do. It&rsquo;s
not to be understood, that strange, unnatural business, if you
haven&rsquo;t experienced it, in your flesh and in your blood, till it
finds its way into your marrow&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe that I also experienced it, once in a
way,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;When I was walking with Van Helderen
by the sea &hellip; and the sky was so far and the night so deep
&hellip; or the rains came rustling towards us from so very far away
and then fell &hellip; or when the nights, silent as death and yet
brimful of sounds, quivered about one, always with a music which one
could not catch and could scarcely hear&#8202;&hellip;. Or simply when
I looked into the eyes of a Javanese, when I spoke to my babu and it
seemed as though nothing of what I said reached her mind and as though
what she replied concealed her real, secret
answer&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, again, is another thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span>can&rsquo;t understand that: as far as I was
concerned, I knew my native through and through. But possibly every
European feels it in a different way, according to his nature and his
temperament. To one it is perhaps the dislike which he begins by
feeling for the country that attacks him in the weak point of his
materialism and continues to oppose him &hellip; whereas the country
itself is so full of poetry, I might almost say mysticism. To another
it is the climate, or the character of the native, or what you will,
that is antagonistic and incomprehensible. To me &hellip; it was the
facts which I could not understand. And until then I had always been
able to understand a fact &hellip; at least, I thought so. Now it
appeared to me as though I no longer understood
anything&#8202;&hellip;. In this way, I became an incompetent official
and then I realized that it was all over. And then I quietly resigned
my post. And now I&rsquo;m here &hellip; and here I mean to stay. And
do you know the strange part of it? Perhaps I have&mdash;at
last&mdash;found my family-circle here&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little brown faces were peeping round the corner. And he called
to them, beckoned to them kindly, with a broad fatherly gesture. But
they pattered away again, audibly, on their bare feet. He laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re very timid, the little monkeys,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Lena&rsquo;s little sisters; and the woman you saw
just now is her mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent for a second, quite simply, as though she was bound to
understand who Lena was: the very young woman, with the golden bloom on
her cheeks and the coal-black <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314"
href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>eyes, of whom she had caught
a fleeting glimpse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then there are some little brothers, who go to school in
Garut. Well, you see, that&rsquo;s my domestic circle. When I came to
know Lena, I adopted the whole family. I admit it costs me a lot of
money, for I have my first wife at Batavia, my second in Paris, and
Ren&eacute; and Ricus in Holland. It all costs me money. And now my new
&lsquo;home-circle&rsquo; here. But now at least I have my
circle&#8202;&hellip;. It&rsquo;s a very Indian kettle of fish,
you&rsquo;ll say: that Indian quasi-marriage to the daughter of a
coffee-overseer, with the old woman and the little brothers and sisters
included in the bargain. But I&rsquo;m doing a little good. The family
haven&rsquo;t a cent and I&rsquo;m helping them. And Lena is a dear
child and is the comfort of my old age. I can&rsquo;t live without a
wife; and so it happened of itself&#8202;&hellip;. And it works very
well: I lead a cabbage-life and drink first-rate coffee; and they look
after the old man&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent and then continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you &hellip; you are going to Europe? Poor Eldersma, I
hope he&rsquo;ll be better soon! It&rsquo;s all my fault, isn&rsquo;t
it? I worked him too hard. But it&rsquo;s like that in India, mevrouw.
We all work too hard here &hellip; until we stop working altogether.
And you are going &hellip; in a week? How glad you will be to see your
father and mother and to hear some good music? I am still always
grateful to you. You did much for us, you stood for poetry in
Labuwangi. Poor India! How they rail at her! After all, the country
can&rsquo;t help it that we freebooters have invaded <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>their territory, barbarian conquerors that we
are, only working to grow rich and get away! And then, when they
don&rsquo;t grow rich, they start railing: at the heat, which God gave
it from the beginning; at the lack of nourishment for mind and soul:
mind and soul of the freebooter! The poor country railed at like this
may well say in itself, &lsquo;You could have stayed away!&rsquo; And
you &hellip; you didn&rsquo;t like India either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to grasp the poetry of it. And now and then I
succeeded. For the rest, it&rsquo;s my fault, resident, and not the
fault of this beautiful country. Like your freebooter, I should have
stayed away. All my depression, all the melancholy from which I
suffered in this beautiful land of mystery, is my own fault. I
don&rsquo;t rail at India, resident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her hand and, almost with emotion, almost with a gleam of
moisture in his eyes, said, softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you for saying so. Those words are like you, the
words of a sensible, cultivated woman, who doesn&rsquo;t rave and rant,
as a silly Dutchman would at not finding in this country exactly what
corresponded with his petty ideals. Your temperament suffered much
here, I know. It was bound to. But it was not the fault of the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my own fault, resident,&rdquo; she repeated, with her
soft, smiling voice.</p>
<p>He thought her adorable. That she did not burst into imprecations,
that she did not fly into ecstasies because she was leaving Java in a
few days&rsquo; time gave him a sense of comfort. And, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span>when
she rose to go, saying that it was getting late, he felt very sad:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I shall never see you again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that we shall be coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good-bye for ever, then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we shall see you in Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a gesture of denial:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am more grateful to you than I can say for coming to look
the old man up. I shall drive with you to Garut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He called out something indoors, where the women were keeping out of
sight and the little sisters giggling. He stepped into the carriage by
her side. They drove down the avenue of ferns; and suddenly they saw
the Sacred Lake of Lell&egrave;s, overshadowed by the circling swirl of
the bats ever flapping round and round:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resident,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I feel it
here&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are only bats,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But at Labuwangi &hellip; it was perhaps only a
rat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He just wrinkled his brows; then he smiled again, with the jovial
smile about his thick moustache, and looked up with inquisitive
eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said, softly. &ldquo;Really? Do you feel it
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s different with
everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant bats shrilled their triumph in shrieks of desolation. The
little carriage drove on and passed a little railway-halt. And, in the
otherwise lonely region, it was strange to see a whole populace, a
swarm of motley Sundanese, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href=
"#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>streaming towards the little
station, eagerly gazing at a slow train which was approaching, belching
black clouds of smoke amidst the bamboos. All their eyes were staring
crazily, as though anticipating the bliss of the first glance, as
though their first impression would be a treasure for their souls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a train full of new hadjis,&rdquo; said Van
Oudijck. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all pilgrims newly returned from
Mecca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The train stopped; and from the long third-class carriages,
solemnly, slowly, very devoutly and conscious of their dignity, the
hadjis alighted, in their rich white-and-yellow turbans, their eyes
gleaming with pride, their lips pursed with conceit, in brand-new,
shiny coats and gold-and-purple skirts which fell in stately folds to
just above their feet. And, humming with rapturous excitement,
sometimes with a rising cry of ecstasy, the waiting multitude pressed
closer and stormed the narrow doorways of the long
railway-coaches&#8202;&hellip;. The hadjis solemnly alighted. And their
brothers and friends vied with one another in grasping their hands and
the hems of their gold-and-purple skirts and kissed that sacred hand or
that sacred garment, because it brought them something of Mecca the
Holy. They fought, they hustled one another around the hadjis, to be
the first to give the kiss. And the hadjis, conceited and
self-conscious, seemed unaware of the struggle, maintained a peaceful
dignity and a solemn stateliness amid the struggle, amid the billowing,
buzzing multitude, and surrendered their hands, surrendered the hem of
their garments to the fanatical kiss of all who approached.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span></p>
<p>And, in this land of profound, secret, slumbering mystery, in this
people of Java, which, as always, hid itself in the secrecy of its
impenetrable soul, suppressed indeed, but visible, it was strange to
see an ecstasy rising to the surface, to see an intoxicated fanaticism,
to see a part of that impenetrable soul revealed in its deification of
those who had beheld the tomb of the prophet, to hear the soft humming
of a religious rapture, to hear, suddenly, unexpectedly, a shout of
glory, not to be suppressed, quavering on high, a cry which instantly
sank again, drowned in the hum, as though itself fearful, because the
sacred era had not yet arrived&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And Van Oudijck and Eva, on the road behind the station, slowly
driving past the busy multitude which still buzzed about the hadjis,
respectfully carrying their luggage, obsequiously offering their little
carts: Van Oudijck and Eva suddenly looked at each other and, though
neither of them cared to express it in words, they told each other with
a glance of understanding, that they felt <i>it</i>, that they felt
<i>that</i>, both of them, both together this time, in the midst of
this fanatical multitude&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>They both felt it, the unutterable thing, the thing that lurks in
the ground, that hisses under the volcanoes, that slowly draws near
with the far-travelled winds, that rushes onwards with the rain, that
rattles by in the heavy, rolling thunder, that is wafted from the far
horizon of the boundless sea; the thing that flashes from the black,
mysterious gaze of the secretive native, that creeps in his heart and
cringes in his humble salutation; the thing that gnaws like a poison
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>and a hostile force at the body, soul and life
of the European, that silently attacks the conqueror and saps his
energies, causing him to pine and perish, sapping his energies very
slowly, so that he wastes away for years; and in the end he dies of it,
perhaps by a sudden, tragic death: they both felt it, both felt the
unutterable thing&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And, in feeling it, together with the sadness of their leave-taking,
which was so near at hand, they failed to see, amid the waving,
billowing, buzzing multitude which reverently hustled the
yellow-and-purple dignity of the hadjis returned from Mecca, they
failed to see that one, tall, white hadji rising above the crowd and
peering with a grin at the man who, though he had lived his life in
Java, had been weaker than That&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
